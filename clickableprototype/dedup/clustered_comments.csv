My understanding is that an estimated 19 percent of SNAP households will receive lower SNAP monthly benefits if this new proposal went into effect. I have several friends who have been struggling to make ends meet and without the full benefits of SNAP they would be more so.  Cutting funds for hungry folks is only going to make conditions in this country worse and likely lead toward more unrest."

My god! Please rethink this action. When I was on snap it was all I had for food for myself and my son.

I don't need or get snap anymore, I'm in a better place and my son is an adult now.

I know that this place that I'm in won't be here till I die, and as a disabled senior I'll have to go back on snap someday. Please don't deny the poor and disabled food.

As the top developed country globally, the United States still has a long way to go in providing for even the basic food needs of our fellow Americans. This is a known fact that Americans and our global neighbors are aware of  as there are on-going public and private solicitations on behalf of a

large disproportionate number of  homeless and hungry individuals, including U.S Service Veterans, families with children, people with disabilities and low income Seniors. 

Instead of cutting any life and health sustaining SNAP benefits to these at risk people, we need to do just the opposite and increase the SNAP budget to insure this fragile lifeline is secure.

This would disproportionately impact seniors and people with disabilities, and would cause a $4.5 billion cut -- over five years -- to SNAP benefits. The current policy, on the other hand, allows states flexibility in how they calculate the costs of SUAs to accommodate for variances from one state to the next. States must be allowed to calculate the costs of utilities as they account for SNAP benefits. I strongly oppose the USDAs new, proposed rule. Please withdraw the rule from further consideration.

I have worked with low income households for many years in New York, Then Pennsylvania then  in Michigan, then New Hampshire, then Massachusetts.  There is an irony which is well framed by this rule. When I worked with rural families, they had less employment income, did not have food, but were housed. By contrast, more of the urban or suburban families I knew, were working, had more income, but could not afford   shelter and were  often on the cusp of homelessness. When I knew them, they had less access to nutritious food, despite their  higher earned income. The current  excess shelter deduction recognizes that people's shelter cost is a determining factor in their  ability to purchase food. They pay the rent, then prepare and buy food. It is a grave mistake to eliminate that obvious recognition from SNAP. I oppose the change"

I ABSOLUTELY DEMAND some kind of Universal Basic Income, which people get regardless of whether or not they are working. The earned income tax credit is not sufficient here since those who do not work do not get it. Moreover, even with current inadequate wages, there still do not seem to be enough jobs for everyone. In addition, there are skill and/or geographical mismatches between some people and the available jobs, a situation that could worsen as more jobs are automated. As far as skills are concerned, it needs to be recognized that dealing with customers is also a skill. For some strange reason, dealing with customers is often not recognized to be a skill.

I also want to add that many years ago, I was a low income young, blind single woman. I received food stamps and some assistance with paying my electric bill. I was out of work, looking and not finding a job. With persistence (and maybe being in the right place at the right time), I got a job. Even back then the statistics were very high for unemployment among blind people. When I was able to send a note to my caseworker and tell her that I had a job, it was a day of celebration. But I needed the help I received, in order to remain independent in my own apartment and to be able to look for jobs.

Donald Trump does not care about any children except his own; and that is questionable based on the uneven manner in which he treats them. I wonder what he would do if he was too poor to feed his children? I suspect he would feed himself first, then the pretty girl, then the first son, then the second son, then the third son, and finally the ""other"" daughter. He is a disgrace and only really cares about himself. What a PIG for a president. The USDA must reject any changes to that rule. Kathy Andersen-Smith"

Furthermore, your own Department reports the following beneficial impact of SNAP on our overall economy: ERS research has estimated a multiplier of SNAP benefits on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of 1.54; that is, an increase of $1 billion in SNAP benefits in a slowing economy increases GDP by $1.54 billion and supports 13,560 additional jobs, including nearly 500 agricultural jobs (farming, forestry, fishing, and hunting).

My personal facts. After a severe car accident where I was hit from behind at 55mph

while waiting for the light to turn green. I am now 100% disabled. I am 57 , live alone, can't shop or do even laundry without help.  I can't work although I have tried many times. Because of this I  receive a food stamp benefit of $42 a month. I used to be able to survive this food struggle by also going to a food bank once a month. Just recently food prices have gone up quite a bit, and my benefit has stayed the same but the money is so little that I am now going to food bank once a week. This is very hard on me because I have to enlist the help of someone to go to the food banks because I can't lift anything heavier that a bar of soap. I share all of this with embarrassment and ask that you increase  benefits for the most vulnerable citizens,"

As a single, over 70 years old, individual  in the state of Arizona, my SNAP benefits are  minimal (only $15 per month), but the do help to stretch the value of the purchasing power of my fixed retirement income. Many others in the program depend on it much more than I do, and the proposed changes would cause even more poverty and homelessness in the country. If anything, SNAP grants should be increased to reflect the real levels of poverty  that exist in this country. 



All lawmakers must realize that it is impossible to legislate poverty out of existence with budget cuts to assistance programs. If you want to end welfare, require that employers pay a guaranteed living wage for all adult workers.

IF it is only to CUT the bailout money to farms then it should be limited to 10% a year so they could see it coming and to either change their things they plant or to get out of the food business like making different kind of crops that has nothing to do with food or completely leave the farm and start some other business.

Sonny Perdue, The idea of developing yet another policy that will have a negative impact on people who depend on SNAP benefits is abhorrent. Standardizing utility caps across the country is unfair and based on suspect data. Utility costs differ from state to state and region to region in most states.

SNAP benefits, which would be substantially cut through this rule change, play a critical role in addressing hunger and food insecurity in our community. It is the first line of defense against hunger for low-income residents. Policymakers recognize that household resources needed to pay for basics such as shelter, utility costs and childcare are not available to purchase food. Under current law, SNAP takes into account the utility expenses of each SNAP household. States adjust household benefits based on a state-specific Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) calculated by the state and approved by USDA.

That is fair and should remain a part of the law. The proposed rule would standardize and cap SUA calculations across the country based on survey data. This would result in dramatic and unjust cuts to SNAP. I urge you to withdraw the proposed rule. Mary Upshaw"

Sonny Perdue, Dear Secretary Sonny Perdue, The Trump Administrations proposal to standardize and cap Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) calculations across the country fails to recognize regional differences in climate & expenses for utilities and could dramatically harm vulnerable Americans. Although I am a Republican & a fiscal conservative who has never received food stamps, I oppose this proposal because it fails to provide for the general welfare and to promote the common defense of Americans guaranteed by the Preamble of our Constitution. Even a cursory scanning of that document reveals the proposal to be morally & constitutionally deficient. Further, the Administrations own data reveals this proposal would cause 19 percent of households currently entitled to SNAP benefits to receive reduced monthly benefits. These reductions would disproportionately harm seniors and the disabled. While a reduction in Federal spending totaling $4.5 billion over five years is meritorious given the present explosion of the Federal deficit, reducing that deficit by burdening the most vulnerable Americans is criminal. It is time to send the idea back to committee & work with the Office of Budget & Management to determine genuinely sound means for reducing Federal spending. Sincerely, John A. Dodd"

Under current law, SNAP takes into account the utility expenses of each SNAP household. States adjust household benefits based on a state-specific Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) calculated by the state and approved by USDA. The current policy allows variances in SUAs to accommodate for differences in utility costs and rates, and allows states flexibility in how they calculate those costs. The proposed rule, however, would standardize and cap SUA calculations across the country based on survey data -- resulting in dramatic cuts to SNAP. For healthier people and communities, don't cut SNAP. Leah Edwards"

It is the first line of defense against hunger for low-income residents. I was once on snap and food stamps. I was working full time and did not receive any benefits. On top of that I was on unpaid personal leave because I couldnt get maternity leave. For those first 6 months of my daughters life I needed these programs to get by because every cent I saved was gone in about a week. Hard working Americans like myself are the people who need and rely on these programs. When situations like mine happen it becomes crucial to have access to programs that will help support our families when our jobs dont provide the security and benefits needed for special circumstance situations like pregnancy.

I personally know a number of people, including family members, here in the Northeast whose utility bills are enormous in comparison with their ""income"" (I use the term loosely to include above-minimum wage, but still starvation level), living in the only type of dwelling they can afford--old, rickety, and inadequately insulated, heat controlled by a landlord who I'm quite sure is violating regulations to keep his costs down (and if you complain, you end up in the street); people who risk their lives using alternate heating sources (kerosene and electric heaters), and who will end up going even more hungry than they do already if this rule change goes through.

I have seen in my teaching how important SNSP hads been so that poor families can get good food to feed their families and therefore teachers know that the students have eaten and are ready to learn. No matter how intelligent or how desirous of earning, if a student consistently does not have food value - protein - theysimply cannot do well and the brain does not develop as well as it could. I saw that while teaching in the Congo and it certainly is true here. 



And I have first -hand example about free or half prices school lunches since we relied on them on furlough from the Congo with our own kids in school. It would have been very hard on us with our low salary if we had had to pay full price for  our four sons' lunches and we weren't nearly as poor as some. These programs are really essential, Mr. President!!

I am writing to offer comments on the proposed rule to standardize the Standard Utility Allowances for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP. I am opposed the proposed change because it will reduce the benefit to American citizens experiencing food insecurity. Food, clothing and shelter represent the basic needs of all humans. We as a country of prosperity owe it to our fellow citizens to assure that these basic needs are available for all. The working poor are often forced to make desperate choices between housing and food, between medicine and food, between a winter coat for their children and food. This is not an acceptable reality. As a health care professional who has worked in a hospital for 40 years, I have personally witnessed the negative health consequences of malnutrition; health and wellness begin with food, clothing and shelter. It is only after these three basic needs are met that we can focus on education, employment and contributing to society. I urge you to reconsider the proposed changes to the SNAP SUA methodology as written as they will have the devastating effect of reducing food security for millions of American citizens. To quote the late Elijah Cummings, ""we are better than that"". Thank you for allowing me to comment on this important concern. Leslie Pires MS PharmD"

This latest effort to eliminate states' ability to factor the cost of utilities into their calculation of SNAP recipients' benefits and eligibility is yet another attempt by the administration to sidestep Congress to cut one of the nation's most effective anti-hunger and anti-poverty programs. SNAP is our country's first-line of defense against hunger, and undercutting its power by reducing the dollars for families will lessen its power.  

North Carolina families struggling to put food on the table shouldn't have their need for sustenance pitted against their need for heat in the winter and air conditioning in the summer. States need the flexibility and ability to ensure federal rules work in our communities. Worse still, seniors and people with disabilities would be hurt the most. 
Unemployed and under-employed have been helped with SNAP assistance, as well as those who may live in food deserts, or not Medicaid eligible and live below poverty level. Families are helped with SNAP to provide the nutrition for their children which has been shown that a nourished child is a child that can learn better and be more attentive then one that doesn't. SNAP is essential for SDOH(social determinants of health) and can help keep health cost down.
$4.5 billion from the program could hurt more than one-third of North Carolinians receiving SNAP benefits.

Poor people deserve to have food enough to sustain them, which lets them continue to work, raise a family, and better themselves, as much as the Rich do. The United States is not a feudal system where the poor die so the King and his people can eat the finest foods, discarding what they will, not even allowing it to be given back to the serfs who made it. Every single U.S. citizen deserves to have food everyday, in the proper amount. To cut off SNAP benefits is to deliberately kill citizens just because they're poor. Policymakers recognize that household resources needed to pay for basics such as shelter, utility costs and childcare are not available to purchase food. Under current law, SNAP takes into account the utility expenses of each SNAP household. States adjust household benefits based on a state-specific Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) calculated by the state and approved by USDA. The current policy allows variances in SUAs to accommodate for differences in utility costs and rates, and allows states flexibility in how they calculate those costs.

I ABSOLUTELY DEMAND some kind of Universal Basic Income, which people get regardless of whether or not they are working. The earned income tax credit is not sufficient here since those who do not work do not get it. Moreover, even with current inadequate wages, there still do not seem to be enough jobs for everyone. In addition, there are skill and/or geographical mismatches between some people and the available jobs, a situation that could worsen as more jobs are automated.

This letter is my formal and official complaint against proposed changes to RIN: 0584-AE69; Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program: Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances. 



The proposed changes substantially cut essential benefits for 7 million Americans who desperately need these services. It is unconscionable for the USDA to even consider these proposed changes. 



This letter serves to demand the USDA withdraw these changes from further consideration. SNAP benefits, which would be substantially cut through this rule change, play a critical role in addressing hunger and food insecurity in our community. It is the first line of defense against hunger for low-income residents. 



Policymakers recognize that household resources needed to pay for basics such as shelter, utility costs, and childcare are not available to purchase food. Under current law, SNAP takes into account the utility expenses of each SNAP household. States adjust household benefits based on a state-specific Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) calculated by the state and approved by USDA. The current policy allows variances in SUAs to accommodate for differences in utility costs and rates and allows states flexibility in how they calculate those costs. 



The proposed rule, however, would standardize and cap SUA calculations across the country based on survey data -- resulting in dramatic cuts to SNAP. The proposal's authors are not ignorant of the damage they are causing. This is an intentional attack on the systems America has put into place to protect the weakest among us. This further destabilizes families and neighborhoods. The elderly, disabled and working poor are being attacked with no lobbying force to fight for them. Each and every American should be horrified at the way the Federal Government is actively dismantling public safety nets,"

Believe me, cutting my SNAP benefits would seriously make me hungry for most of the month. I need every cent I get; even if it is only $16.00 per month.



Please dson't assume anyone can live on less than my $891.00 a month! Thank heavens I don't have children to live on that amount. They'd all be as hungry as I am.

SNAP benefits, which would be substantially cut through this rule change, play a critical role in addressing hunger and food insecurity in our community. It is the first line of defense against hunger for low-income residents. 



Policymakers recognize that household resources needed to pay for basics such as shelter, utility costs and childcare are not available to purchase food. Under current law, SNAP takes into account the utility expenses of each SNAP household. States adjust household benefits based on a state-specific Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) calculated by the state and approved by USDA. The current policy allows variances in SUAs to accommodate for differences in utility costs and rates, and allows states flexibility in how they calculate those costs. 



The proposed rule, however, would standardize and cap SUA calculations across the country based on survey data -- resulting in dramatic cuts to SNAP.



It is insane to look at utility costs in Wyoming as being the same for a poor family in North Carolina. Or New York City as the same as Giles county Virginia. I thought States having flexibility to meet their specific needs was a reason not to have federal rules tying their hands.  I've lived on SNAP, and it worked as long as I fixed everything from scratch and shopped several times a week for last day of sale items. Most SNAP recipients don't have that ability. Cutting the amounts is not only bad for those most vulnerable, it will harm the economy, as SNAP is one of the programs that multiplies in the economy rather than just spends money , like tax cuts to those who least need them.

This latest effort to eliminate states' ability to factor the cost of utilities into their calculation of SNAP recipients' benefits and eligibility is yet another attempt by the administration to sidestep Congress to cut one of the nation's most effective anti-hunger and anti-poverty programs. SNAP is our country's first-line of defense against hunger, and undercutting its power by reducing the dollars for families will lessen its power.

Sonny Perdue, RIN: 0584-AE69; Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program: Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances I believe in an America that does not turn a blind eye to people who are hungry and struggling to meet their basic needs. SNAP is our most critical and effective tool in providing food for hungry families - a basic human right. Rather than enacting more restrictions and cuts to SNAP like this proposed rule, we should be expanding eligibility and benefits to ensure that no one goes hungry. States must be allowed to calculate the costs of utilities as they account for SNAP benefits. The proposed USDA rule unfairly standardizes and caps Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) calculations across the country based on inadequate survey data -- resulting in dramatic cuts to the food stamps program. The current policy, on the other hand, allows variances in SUAs to accommodate for differences in utility costs and rates, and allows states flexibility in how they calculate those costs. This local flexibility is important because utility rates and costs are vastly different depending on where you live. The Trump administrations own data concedes that the proposed rule would cause 19 percent of SNAP households to get lower SNAP monthly benefits, would disproportionately impact elderly people and people with disabilities, and would cause a national net cut to SNAP benefits amounting to $4.5 billion over five years. I strongly oppose the proposed rule. Please withdraw the rule from further consideration and reject any changes to the current rule. Jody Chong"

We are not talking about much money on an individual basis - I receive just enough to alleviate the pressure and stress of putting food on the table for me and my household.

I did have good education,  but unfortunately  I could only find multiple part time jobs that paid poorly.  I worked hard and kept applying for jobs. I was lucky to get food stamps but wasn't able to keep them despite poverty. If businesses and schools are allowed to pay poverty wages that don't cover rent and food, then the government needs to pick up the slack. After all, the American people benefit financially by paying very little for goods and services because of the low wages. So, either require living wages, or pick up the slack. And for those that can't find work,help them to d"

Is it not amazing that those that are rich are the most stingy. The rich and powerful have no clue what it may be to not have enough money to cover living expenses and have the privilege of eating. Whereas many poor have McDonald's or Burger King; the rich go to the Ritz or other such places where meals  can cost $50-$100 per person and that does not include beverages, deserts or whatever and valet parking and any tips. While the cost of living keeps exculpating wages have hardly changes in 40 years. The other trouble is that the rich keep getting tax cuts while the middle class has for the most part disappeared and the poor now is the great majority. To make matters worse housing is also approaching a non-affordable level and that is why now the nation has such a homelessness issue.

On behalf of Foodshare, I appreciate the opportunity to comment on USDAs Notice of Proposed Rule regarding Supplemental Assistance Nutrition Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances (SUAs). The proposed rule would exacerbate the struggles many low-income people have paying for both food and utilities.  The estimated $4.5 billion in cuts over five years would have harmful impacts on health and well-being while severely straining our limited resources for providing food to people in need. The proposed rule is flawed and should be withdrawn.

Foodshare is the regional food bank serving Connecticuts Hartford and Tolland counties, where 1 in 9 people are food insecure. At Foodshare, we recognize that access to basic food is fundamental to a persons ability to lead a healthy, productive life. Foodshare works hard to stretch our limited resources, food donations and space to help as many people as we can  distributing more than 11 million meals each year. Even with all of this effort, hunger is still a persistent and pervasive issue in our region. 

Policymakers recognize that household resources needed to pay for basics such as shelter, utility costs and childcare are not available to purchase food.  Under current law, SNAP takes into account the utility expenses of each SNAP household. The current policy allows variances in SUAs between states to accommodate differences in utility expenses, and allows states flexibility in how they calculate those costs. The proposed rule would standardize and cap SUA calculations across the country resulting in a 9.3% overall decrease in benefits for Connecticut residents. According USDA estimates, the change will decrease or cut off SNAP benefits for 44.81% of enrolled households in Connecticut.  Additionally, the rule is expected to disproportionately impact elderly people and people with disabilities.

SNAP is our nations first line of defense against hunger, helping millions of low-income Americans put food on the table. Currently, for each meal provided by the network of Feeding America food banks, of which Foodshare is a member, SNAP provides nine meals. Foodshare is already hard-pressed to meet the high demand for assistance that exists in our community, and we simply cannot compensate for the added need that would result from this harmful proposal.

USDA should be strengthening the positive impacts of SNAP for health, well-being and economic activity, not making cuts to SNAP benefits. I strongly oppose the proposed rule and request the USDA withdraw the rule and work with states to improve their SUAs under existing flexibility.

09000064841d53ec,82,3,1,614,"Dear SNAP Certification Policy Branch:
 
On behalf of the Food Research & Action Center (FRAC), and residents of Vermont (VT) who are similarly situated I appreciate the opportunity to comment on USDA's Notice of Proposed Rule regarding Supplemental Assistance Nutrition Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances. According to the Department's own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years.The proposed rule would exacerbate the struggles many low-income people have paying for costs of both food and utilities. It would have harmful impacts on health and well-being as well as on the economy. The proposed rule is flawed and should be withdrawn.
 
Further, on the subject of SNAP, to curb the inevitable effects of the standardizing methodology to asses utility and food assistance, I urge the federal agency to concoct a rule for all state's to mandatorily asses quality of their regional markets of utilities providing fuel assistance.

As a disabled person from a low-income household, I receive fuel assistance towards the need of heating, and also firsthand recognize the subject of retaliation. 
 
SNAP plays a critical role in addressing hunger and food insecurity in my community. It is the first line of defense against hunger for low-income residents.
 
Policymakers recognize that household resources needed to pay for basics such as shelter, utility costs and childcare are not available to purchase food.  Under current law, SNAP takes into account the utility expenses of each SNAP household.  States adjust household benefits based on a state-specific Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) calculated by the state and approved by USDA. The current policy allows variances in SUAs to accommodate for differences in utility costs and rates, and allows states flexibility in how they calculate those costs.
 
The proposed rule would standardize and cap SUA calculations across the country based on survey data. The proposed rule does not adequately explain USDA's rationale for capping the largest of the SUA components by calibrating to utility expense survey data for those no higher than the 80th percentile of low-income people and then capping other SUA components as well.   The proposed rule merely asserts that it calculated calibrating to the 50th percentile compared to the 80th percentile.  The proposed rule does not adequately explain whether USDA analyzed impacts calibrated to the 85th or higher percentiles and what the results of those estimates were.   The lack of such explanation is particularly concerning given research documented that 21 states had SUAs exceeding the 85th percentile estimates, possibly because in their efforts to mitigate benefit loss for households with very high utility costs.
 
The Administration concedes that the proposed rule would cause 19 percent of SNAP households to get lower SNAP monthly benefits, would disproportionately impact elderly people and people with disabilities, and would cause a national net cut to SNAP benefits amounting to $4.5 billion over five years.

The food security and health implications of the proposed rule are serious and disturbing.  Food insecurity has direct and indirect impacts on physical and mental health for people of all ages. Food insecurity  and even marginal food security (a less severe level of food insecurity) is especially detrimental to the health, development, and well-being of infants, children, and adolescents.

Older adults and people with disabilities will be disparately impacted as well. 

SNAP plays a critical role in improving the food security, health, and well-being of program participants across the lifespan.  Conversely, research shows that a loss or reduction in SNAP benefits has detrimental impacts on food insecurity and health, especially for children and their families. 

Older adults and people with disabilities will be disparately impacted by the proposed rule.  SNAP plays an important role in supporting the food security, nutrition, and health of older adults, allowing them to maintain their independence while also reducing their health care utilization and costs.  People with disabilities are at higher risk of food insecurity, making SNAP a critical support for this vulnerable population as well. Furthermore, those impacted by food insecurity are likely experiencing additional resource-related hardships, such as housing instability and energy insecurity.  An emerging body of evidence demonstrates that SNAP supports housing stability and alleviates the trade-offs families often are forced to make between food, health care, and other basic necessities.

I strongly oppose the proposed rule that would cut food benefits for struggling people and undermine health in our community and across our nation."
0900006484176c32,82,4,1,615,"Once again, the Administration is proposing a rule that would have a devastating effect on Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participants.  The rule, Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances, would change states ability to account for the costs of utilities (including home heating and cooling) as they calculate SNAP household benefits.  The change will result in 19 percent of SNAP households getting lower SNAP monthly benefits and will disproportionately affect seniors and people with disabilities.  This rule would result in a $4.5 billion net cut to SNAP benefits over five years.  The Alliance to End Hunger strongly opposes such a plan and urges the withdrawal of the proposal.

Currently, SNAP rules allow states to take some critical household expenses (such as housing, childcare and utilities) into account when determining eligibility for SNAP and the size of a households monthly benefit amount.  States adjust household benefits based on a state-specific Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) calculated by the state and approved by USDA. The current policy allows variances in SUAs to accommodate for differences in utility costs-allowing states flexibility in how they calculate those costs.  The proposed rule would standardize and cap SUA calculations across the country rather than allowing states to set their own rates.  The rule would not result in a more accurate measurement of the true costs of families utility bills.

The Administrations plan to standardize and cap SUAs would result in a significant rise in hunger among our most vulnerable residents.  Millions of low-income households struggle to pay for food, utilities and other household expenses.  The proposed rule would lower SUAs in 28 states resulting in lower SNAP benefits for millions of participants.  
SNAP is an efficient program that stimulates local economies and helps families thrive.  The numerous positive impacts of SNAP on participants health and household well-being are well-founded.  These kinds of policy changes were not included in the bipartisan 2018 Farm Bill after vigorous review and debate.  The Administration should not impose a rule that will limit states flexibility and deny families access to food.  The Alliance to End Hunger calls on the Administration to withdraw this proposal.  We encourage Alliance members and partners to submit comments by December 2nd.  

We will continue to work with our network, as well as Members of Congress and the Administration, to ensure SNAP is protected and continues to play a vital role in the lives of food-insecure families.

The Alliance to End Hunger engages diverse institutions to build the public and political will to end hunger at home and abroad.  Our 100 member organizations span nonprofit, faith, corporate, academic and philanthropic sectors."

This would mean households missing out on nutritious food to stay healthy, our local food system being hurt including grocers and farmers receiving less money, and our overall state's well being going down. 

The rule's proposal to change the way the Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) is calculated to make it standardized and capped across the country is misguided. The current law allows variances in SUAs to accommodate for differences in utility costs and rates, and allows states flexibility in how they calculate those costs. This is important for Oregon where we have high heating costs. The current law works because it allows for SNAP benefits to take into account the utility expenses of each SNAP household and for states to adjust benefits based on the state-specific SUA that is based on analysis and information from local public utilities. Changing this calculation, as the proposed rule says, will not take into account true costs of utility expenses for SNAP households. 

This proposed rule is another attempt to cut SNAP benefits and circumvent Congress. It does not help ensure more Americans have the nutrition they need to thrive, but instead would increase hunger throughout the country. USDA should be strengthening the positive impacts of SNAP for health, well-being and economic activity, not making cuts to SNAP benefits. I strongly oppose the proposed rule and request the USDA withdraw the rule and work with states to improve their SUA's under existing flexibility.

09000064841db999,82,7,1,618,"On behalf of the Greater Chicago Food Depository, I am writing to comment on the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Notice of Proposed Rule regarding the Supplemental Assistance Nutrition Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances (SUA) that would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years, according to the Departments own estimate.

The proposed rule is flawed and should be withdrawn. This rule would exacerbate the struggles of many low-income people having difficulty paying for food and utilities.  It would have harmful impacts on their health and well-being as well as on the broader economy. 

The Greater Chicago Food Depository works in partnership with 700 agencies and programs to distribute food throughout Cook County, Illinois. We support food pantries, soup kitchens, and shelters as well as targeted responses for children, older adults and veterans. Last year, we distributed 74.8 million pounds of food, the equivalent of 62 million meals. We also work to address the root cause of hunger through key initiatives, such as job training, benefits outreach, and policy and advocacy. 

The Food Depository has a unique lens into how those experiencing food insecurity must make tough choices between paying for food, housing, utilities, medication, and other basic needs. Under current law, SNAP takes into account the utility expenses of each SNAP household.  States adjust household benefits based on a state-specific SUA calculated by the state and approved by USDA. The current policy allows variances in SUAs to accommodate for differences in utility costs and rates and allows states flexibility in how they calculate those costs. 

The proposed rule would standardize and cap SUA calculations across the country based on survey data without explaining USDAs rationale for capping the largest of the SUA components by calibrating to utility expense survey data for those no higher than the 80th percentile of low-income people and then capping other SUA components as well.   The proposed rule only asserts that its calculated calibrating to the 50th percentile compared to the 80th percentile.  It also fails to sufficiently explain whether USDA analyzed impacts calibrated to the 85th or higher percentiles and what the results of those estimates were.   This lack of explanation is particularly concerning given research documented that 21 states had SUAs exceeding the 85th percentile estimates, possibly because in their efforts to mitigate benefit loss for households with very high utility costs. 

The proposed rule does little more than ensure that more American families struggling to make ends meet will have to make tough choice between paying for food and other critical household expenses. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, nearly one-third of U.S. households experienced energy insecurity at one point or another. These households frequently make ends meet by forgoing other basics need in order to pay their utilities, such as experiencing temporary disconnections in services, or keeping their homes at unhealthy temperatures to manage their consumption.  More than one-third of Illinois households are considered low-income, meaning they earn less than $30,000 annually. Cutting SNAP benefits to families that are already struggling to pay for basic necessities will only increase the burden of choosing between keeping food in the table or keeping the lights on. The Administration concedes that the proposed rule would cause 19 percent of SNAP households to receive lower SNAP monthly benefits, would disproportionately impact elderly people and people with disabilities, and would cause a national net cut to SNAP benefits amounting to $4.5 billion over five years.

This USDA rulemaking is another attempt by the Administration to side step Congress and make cuts to SNAP benefits.  Congress reviewed SNAP policy during the 2018 Farm Bill, including the fact that states may exercise various options that may produce differences in SNAP eligibility and benefit amounts from state to state.  Although the Presidents fiscal year 2019 budget request included a change like the proposed SUA rule,  Congress rejected such a change in the 2018 Farm Bill.  Indeed, evening out benefit amounts across states by lowering benefits for large numbers of participants does not promote SNAPs statutory purpose, but instead undermines its statutory purpose.

USDA should be strengthening the positive impacts that SNAP has on individual health and well-being and community economic activity, not making cuts to SNAP benefits.  On behalf of the Greater Chicago Food Depository and the men, women, and children we serve, I strongly oppose the proposed rule and request the USDA withdraw the rule and work with states to improve their SUAs under existing flexibility.

Sincerely,

Each day, food pantries and soup kitchens provide meals to people when SNAP benefits are unavailable or insufficient for a household's nutritional needs. This dangerous proposal would force more people onto the lines of the emergency food network whose resources are already stretched too thin.

Food Bank For New York City is a major hunger relief organization serving the five boroughs of New York City. Our mission is to end hunger by organizing food, information and support for community survival, empowerment, and dignity. Our organization serves approximately 1.5 million New York City residents every year through a network of nearly 1,000 charities, community-based organizations and schools across the city. SNAP is our nation's first line of defense against hunger and plays a critical role in addressing hunger and food insecurity among low-income New Yorkers who struggle to put food on the table.  

Every year, through our SNAP outreach work, we assist thousands of low-income New York City residents to enroll in SNAP. 95% of the clients we reach through that service qualify for the Standard Utility Allowance. The current structure for Standard Utility Allowances works to account for regional differences in utility and cost of living in places like New York State where we experience a significantly higher utility costs - electricity alone was 54% higher in New York than the national average.  Because costs of living expenses like utilities, shelter, and personal care items often compete with food for the last dime of low-income residents household budgets, this proposal to force a one-sized-fits all structure would increase hunger among low-income people in our country. 

Food Bank For New York City is also the main supplier of food to our city's network of food pantries and soup kitchens, charities that consistently report food shortages. Indeed, more than half of food pantries and soup kitchens in New York City reported experiencing food shortages in October 2019.  We know all too well that charity cannot fill the gaps left behind when our federal anti-hunger policy supports are withdrawn. By USDA's estimates, this proposal would cut SNAP food assistance by $4.5 billion over five years. In New York nearly 450,000 SNAP households - nearly 1 in 3 - would see their benefits slashed on average of $63 per month in benefits. This cut would result in the loss of 9 million meals every month in a state that already experiences a Meal Gap of 385 million meals per year.  This loss of more than $345 million in food assistance benefits will pushing more of our neighbors onto the lines of emergency food providers.

If this rule were to go into effect, the health of low-income people would suffer. Healthy food items are both more expensive at grocery stores, and also more in need a food pantries and soup kitchens. Fresh fruit and vegetables are often the hardest items for charities to secure and often the most expensive items in our poorest communities: 73% of our network of emergency food providers report needing more fresh fruit and vegetables.  This proposal to take needed food resources away would further deny our poorest neighbors access to fresh fruit and vegetables - staples of a healthy diet and lifestyle.
The economic impact of this rule change would extend beyond the thousands of households who rely on SNAP for food, to business that rely on SNAP dollars. Every dollar spent in SNAP benefits adds $1.79 to the local economy - which, last year in New York City alone, equaled over $5 billion of economic activity in our own neighborhoods.

In 36 years of service to low income New Yorkers, we have provided more than 1.2 billion meals to New Yorkers in need. Our income support services, including SNAP enrollment and free tax assistance for the working poor, put more than $110 million each year into the pockets of New Yorkers, helping them to afford food and achieve greater dignity and independence. In addition, Food Bank's nutrition education programs and services empower more than 50,000 children, teens and adults to sustain a healthy diet on a limited budget. As one of our country's most robust anti-hunger organizations, we are deeply troubled by this proposal that would prevent thousands of New Yorkers from accessing the food they need to survive. We urge the federal government to not adopt this proposal, and urge the Administration to focus on protecting people in America from hunger. Food Bank For New York City strongly opposes this proposal regarding the ""Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances"".

I personally know people that depend on SNAP, including the disabled and elderly. Cutting these programs endangers them. Period. I've read the proposals, and I see that you talk about making it more consistent from state to state, but the bottom line is that this will take away benefits from those who desperately need it. If you want to reform things, do so in a way that does not reduce peoples benefits anywhere. I'll be listening. I adamantly oppose any changes that would result in the loss of needed benefits that would increase food insecurity in this country and have a ripple effect to poor communities nationally.

SNAP's statutory purpose, as declared by Congress, is ""to promote the general welfare, to safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation's population by raising levels of nutrition among low-income households. Congress finds that the limited food purchasing power of low-income households contributes to hunger and malnutrition among members of such households. Congress further finds that increased utilization of food in establishing and maintaining adequate national levels of nutrition will promote the distribution in a beneficial manner of the Nation's agricultural abundance and will strengthen the Nation's agricultural economy, as well as result in more orderly marketing and distribution of foods. To alleviate such hunger and malnutrition, a supplemental nutrition assistance program is herein authorized which will permit low-income households to obtain a more nutritious diet through normal channels of trade by increasing food purchasing power for all eligible households who apply for participation."" 

SNAP plays a critical role in addressing hunger and food insecurity in our community. It is the first line of defense against hunger for low-income residents.

SNAP benefits respond quickly and effectively to changes in need, whether due to economic downturns or natural disasters. According to recent studies, it is estimated that $1 of SNAP benefits leads to between $1.50 and $1.80 in total economic activity during a recession.

Policymakers recognize that household resources needed to pay for basics such as shelter, utility costs and childcare are not available to purchase food.  Under current law, SNAP takes into account the utility expenses of each SNAP household.  States adjust household benefits based on a state-specific Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) calculated by the state and approved by USDA. The current policy allows variances in SUAs to accommodate for differences in utility costs and rates, and allows states flexibility in how they calculate those costs.

SNAP plays a critical role in addressing hunger and food insecurity in our community. It is the first line of defense against hunger for low-income residents.

This proposal would have a particularly harmful impact in Colorado, where the cost of utilities and shelter is often higher than in other states.

0900006484191909,82,33,1,644,"Dear SNAP Certification Policy Branch:
On behalf of the Fiscal Policy Institute (FPI), I appreciate the opportunity to comment on USDAs Notice of Proposed Rule regarding Supplemental Assistance Nutrition Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances. According to the Departments own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years.The proposed rule would exacerbate the struggles many low-income people have paying for costs of both food and utilities.  It would have harmful impacts on health and well-being as well as on the economy. The proposed rule is flawed and should be withdrawn.
 
SNAP plays a critical role in addressing hunger and food insecurity in our community. It is the first line of defense against hunger for low-income residents. This proposed rule would reduce SNAP benefits by an average of $63.00/month for 450,000 households and will reduce SNAP benefits by 8 percent statewide. For a single parent raising a child, the average food budget for New York State is estimated to be $344.00/month. This rule would eliminate 18 percent of this familys available money for nutritious food. Over 2 million New Yorkers are already food insecure and a large percentage can and should be helped by SNAP. USDA should not reduce the positive impacts of the program when so many people are and can be helped by its benefits.
 
Policymakers recognize that household resources needed to pay for basics such as shelter, utility costs and childcare are not available to purchase food.  Under current law, SNAP takes into account the utility expenses of each SNAP household.  States adjust household benefits based on a state-specific Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) calculated by the state and approved by USDA. The current policy allows variances in SUAs to accommodate for differences in utility costs and rates, and allows states flexibility in how they calculate those costs.
 
The proposed rule would standardize and cap SUA calculations across the country based on survey data. The proposed rule does not adequately explain USDAs rationale for capping the largest of the SUA components by calibrating to utility expense survey data for those no higher than the 80th percentile of low-income people and then capping other SUA components as well. The proposed rule merely asserts that it calculated calibrating to the 50th percentile compared to the 80th percentile. It does not adequately explain whether USDA analyzed impacts calibrated to the 85th or higher percentiles and what the results of those estimates were.  The lack of such explanation is particularly concerning given research documented that 21 states had SUAs exceeding the 85th percentile estimates, possibly because in their efforts to mitigate benefit loss for households with very high utility costs.
 
The Administration concedes that the proposed rule would cause 19 percent of SNAP households to get lower SNAP monthly benefits, would disproportionately impact elderly people and people with disabilities, and would cause a national net cut to SNAP benefits amounting to $4.5 billion over five years.The food security and health implications of the proposed rule are serious and disturbing.  Food insecurity has direct and indirect impacts on physical and mental health for people of all ages. Food insecurity  and even marginal food security (a less severe level of food insecurity) is especially detrimental to the health, development, and well-being of infants, children, and adolescents. Lack of access to food has a lasting and negative impact on peoples lives and livelihood. Children who are food insecure are sick more often, recover from illness more slowly, and are hospitalized more frequently. If we, as a country, are truly focused on the well-being of youth, then we must ensure that no child goes hungry.

This USDA rulemaking is yet another attempt for the Administration to side step Congress and make cuts to SNAP benefits.  Congress reviewed SNAP policy during the 2018 Farm Bill, including the fact that states have options that may produce differences in SNAP eligibility benefit amounts from state to state.  Although the Presidents FY 2019 Budget included a request for a change similar to the proposed, Congress did not include such a change in the 2018 Farm Bill.  Indeed, evening out benefit amounts across states by lowering benefits for large numbers of participants does not promote SNAPs statutory purpose, but instead undermines its statutory purpose.

FPI strongly opposes the proposed rule that would cut food benefits for struggling people and undermine health in New York State and across our nation.

SNAPs statutory purpose, as declared by Congress, is to promote the general welfare, to safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation's population by raising levels of nutrition among low-income households. Congress finds that the limited food purchasing power of low-income households contributes to hunger and malnutrition among members of such households. Congress further finds that increased utilization of food in establishing and maintaining adequate national levels of nutrition will promote the distribution in a beneficial manner of the Nation's agricultural abundance and will strengthen the Nation's agricultural economy, as well as result in more orderly marketing and distribution of foods. To alleviate such hunger and malnutrition, a supplemental nutrition assistance program is herein authorized which will permit low-income households to obtain a more nutritious diet through normal channels of trade by increasing food purchasing power for all eligible households who apply for participation. 

SNAP plays a critical role in addressing hunger and food insecurity in our community. It is the first line of defense against hunger for low-income residents.

Insert information about the positive impacts that SNAP has for health and well-being and for economic activity for local communitiessee, e.g., information contained in http://frac.org/wp-content/uploads/frac-facts-snap-strengths.pdf] 

SNAP benefits respond quickly and effectively to changes in need, whether due to economic downturns or natural disasters. According to recent studies, it is estimated that $1 of SNAP benefits leads to between $1.50 and $1.80 in total economic activity during a recession. [See The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Economy:  New Estimates of the SNAP Multiplier, USDA Economic Research Service, July 2019, available at https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/93529/err-265.pdf?v=8010.7 pages 6-8 and Table 1 (regarding research by Blinder and Zandi)]

AND, the rule undermines the will of Congress and the general public, who overwhelmingly rejected proposed farm bill provisions that would have reduced SNAP benefit levels or participation."

According to the Department's own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years.

The proposed change to the HCSUA runs counter to SNAP's statutory purpose ""to promote the general welfare, to safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation's population by raising levels of nutrition among low-income households.""  The proposed rule would exacerbate the struggles many low-income people have paying for costs of both food and utilities.  It would have harmful impacts on health and well-being as well as on the economy. The proposed rule is flawed and should be withdrawn.  

Growing Home serves low-income families with children in the Denver metro area, providing supportive services to strengthen families, nurture children, and connect community for the past 21 years.  Growing Home's services include a food pantry that is on track to host over 4,300 visits in 2019, an increase of nearly 20% over 2018 and an indicator of how endemic food insecurity is in this community.  The families Growing Home serves are also dealing with rapidly rising housing costs due to development and gentrification of previously affordable neighborhoods, and many families are already stretched to their limits.  Even a modest reduction to SNAP benefits will throw families into crisis as they find themselves even less able to make ends meet.  

Growing Home's food pantry, like many other area food pantries and food banks, is already operating at capacity due to the aforementioned increase in demand.  If the proposed change to the HCSUA is approved, 40% of SNAP families in Colorado are projected to experience a cut in benefits according to the Regulatory Impact Analysis produced by the United States Department of Agriculture (7 CFR Part 273).  If this happens, Growing Home anticipates a serious spike in demand as families seek supplemental food assistance to replace lost SNAP benefits.  While the proposed rule change is billed as a cost-saving measure, it only serves to shift demand from government programs to nonprofits and social service agencies, as struggling families must turn elsewhere to keep their children fed and warm.  

This proposed rule change is one of five recent proposals that would negatively impact SNAP recipients presented in recent months, including a proposed work requirement that was initially debated in 2018 and struck from the Farm Bill (the legislation that authorizes and funds SNAP) prior to its passage.  Additional proposed changes impacting SNAP include ending broad-based categorical eligibility that facilitates SNAP enrollment, changes to the Public Charge rule that would penalize potential citizenship applicants for utilizing public benefits, adjusting how the federal poverty level is determined, and this proposed rule change to standardize calculation of the heating and cooling allowance used to calculate benefit levels for SNAP.  Taken together, these proposals represent a coordinated attack on an essential food assistance program and on the millions of families that rely on this assistance to put food on the table.  

A single standard HCSUA is a one-size-fits-all approach that will create harm by nickel and diming families that have neither nickels nor dimes to spare.  SNAP was created to address food insecurity, and this rule change will instead increase it, causing suffering and harm to vulnerable families and depriving children of nutritious food during their crucial formative years.  We write to ask that this proposed rule change be discarded, for the sake of struggling families in our community and across our nation.

Dear Sec. Perdue and the USDA,



SNAPs statutory purpose as declared by Congress is to promote the general welfare, to safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation's population by raising levels of nutrition among low-income households. Therefore, to help preserve the essential mission of SNAP, you must reject the rule up for consideration since it unfairly cuts $4.5 billion from low-income families who need it most by undermining states' ability to determine the factors and utility costs they use to determine eligibility. Under current law, SNAP takes into account the utility expenses of each SNAP household, with states adjusting household benefits based on a state-specific SUA/Standard Utility Allowance calculated by the state to accommodate for differences in utility costs and rates, and approved by USDA.



Current policy recognizes that utility costs vary, allowing flexibility in how states calculate those costs, but the proposed USDA rule takes this flexibility from the states and, as a result, cuts the food aid millions of families would receive. This new USDA rule is, therefore, flawed and must be rejected.

Dear SNAP Program Design Branch:

As a private citizen and taxpayer, I strongly oppose the U.S. Department of Agriculture's proposed revision of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) rules changing how states determine the standard utility allowance (SUA) for low income households. By the USDA's own estimate, the proposed rule will cut SNAP benefits by over $4.5 billion dollars over five years. 

Massachusetts has some of the highest costs of living, including for housing, utilities, and child care, nationwide. SNAP is a lifeline that keeps our communities healthy and strong, particularly when faced with fixed incomes or stagnant wages and increasing costs. 

In Massachusetts alone, the proposed rule is projected to cut benefits for 40 percent of SNAP households by an average of $50 per month. That is a loss of $100 million per year in nutrition assistance for needing families and economic activity for Massachusetts businesses. Such cuts stand in stark contrast to the program's mandated purpose.

Additionally, the USDA has failed to justify why a national standard for the SUA calculation is necessary, especially considering this proposal would cut food access for 7 million people leading to higher food insecurity, worsened health, and higher healthcare costs. Differences across states lines is not sufficient justification, as many aspects of life reasonable vary from state-to-state.

I respectfully request that the USDA rescind this proposed rule and allow states to continue determining the best way to serve their residents with the SUA based on up-to-date, relevant data for utility costs as currently overseen by their regional Food and Nutrition Service offices. 


Sincerely,

09000064841d242f,82,56,1,667,"This proposed rule would cut program benefits by a total of $4.5 billion over five years with a disproportionate impact on the elderly and people with disabilities. The standardization of state heating and cooling Standard Utility Allowances (SUAs) is misguided for a number of reasons: (1) it will exacerbate the struggles that many low-income people have paying for the cost of two basic human necessities - food and utilities; (2) it will have harmful effects on the health and well-being of already economically disadvantaged people; (3) it will cause 19 percent of SNAP households, many with children, to get lower SNAP monthly benefits; and (4) it will be especially detrimental in high energy cost states. SNAP's statutory purpose is to promote the general welfare and to safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation's population by raising levels of nutrition among low-income households. This proposed rule undermines this statutory purpose and is an attempt to subvert Congressional intent.

There already is a recognition that household resources needed to pay for such critical basic needs such as shelter, utility costs and childcare are not available to purchase food. The current policy allows variances in state-specific SUAs to accommodate for differences in costs and rates, and allows the states flexibility in how those costs are calculated. The proposed rule, however, would standardize and cap SUA calculations across the country (which is analogous to an attempt to insert a square peg into a round hole) with a one-size-fits-all approach. The overall outcome would be a process that inaccurately assesses the demographics & economic realities in various states and regions across the country.  Ultimately, the health and well-being of a significant number of individuals and families would be put in jeopardy. 

The USDA should not be weakening the positive impacts of SNAP nor undermining the decisions of Congress. Instead, the USDA should be looking to strengthen SNAP in order to fulfill the Program's statutory purpose and to follow through with policies that best protect the health, well-being and general welfare of people across the entire country.  Therefore, I strongly oppose this proposed rule and request that the USDA withdraw it.  Instead, the country would be better served if the USDA dedicated their time and resources to partner with each state in order to improve upon the SUAs under the existing regulatory framework.

I strongly oppose the proposed rule change, as I believe it is fatally flawed. Fatally, in that it could prove to be fatal for some recipients, particularly elderly & disabled individuals. These recipients often live alone & therefore, already receive less in SNAP benefits than do families. They're barely getting enough to eat as it is & go to bed hungry, or skip eating lunch in order to have that food for their evening meal. Numerous studies have shown that ""NUTRITION MATTERS"" when it comes to our health. In a Country as wealthy as ours, no one should have to go to bed hungry!  I doubt you've ever had that experience, but it's one that I, & millions of other Americans have had & I assure you ~ it isn't pleasant!  Skipping a midday meal now & then is NOT what I'm talking about here. If you skip a meal, you can snack, or eat more at your next meal. Those things are not options for people trying to get by on what SNAP benefits provide them!

In addition to the obvious - hunger - there are health issues to consider. For people who are elderly, on disability, or have chronic illness, health problems within their family, being able to eat enough healthy foods can help them maintain health; whereas, poor nutrition makes it worse. Any money USDA thinks it's saving by cuts made in SNAP, is nothing compared to increased costs in medical care that would be caused by a lack of nutritious variety of foods & having enough of it t"

As a School Meal Program Director, and reduction in SNAP benefits will have a negative effect on our ability to provide free meals to needy households.

SNAPs statutory purpose, as declared by Congress, is to promote the general welfare, to safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation's population by raising levels of nutrition among low-income households. Congress finds that the limited food purchasing power of low-income households contributes to hunger and malnutrition among members of such households. Congress further finds that increased utilization of food in establishing and maintaining adequate national levels of nutrition will promote the distribution in a beneficial manner of the Nation's agricultural abundance and will strengthen the Nation's agricultural economy, as well as result in more orderly marketing and distribution of foods. To alleviate such hunger and malnutrition, a supplemental nutrition assistance program is herein authorized which will permit low-income households to obtain a more nutritious diet through normal channels of trade by increasing food purchasing power for all eligible households who apply for participation. 

SNAP plays a critical role in addressing hunger and food insecurity in our community. It is the first line of defense against hunger for low-income residents.

SNAP benefits respond quickly and effectively to changes in need, whether due to economic downturns or natural disasters. According to recent studies, it is estimated that $1 of SNAP benefits leads to between $1.50 and $1.80 in total economic activity during a recession. [See The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Economy:  New Estimates of the SNAP Multiplier, USDA Economic Research Service, July 2019, available at https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/93529/err-265.pdf?v=8010.7 pages 6-8 and Table 1 (regarding research by Blinder and Zandi)]
Policymakers recognize that household resources needed to pay for basics such as shelter, utility costs and childcare are not available to purchase food.  Under current law, SNAP takes into account the utility expenses of each SNAP household.  States adjust household benefits based on a state-specific Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) calculated by the state and approved by USDA. The current policy allows variances in SUAs to accommodate for differences in utility costs and rates, and allows states flexibility in how they calculate those costs. 

The proposed rule would standardize and cap SUA calculations across the country based on survey data. The proposed rule does not adequately explain USDAs rationale for capping the largest of the SUA components by calibrating to utility expense survey data for those no higher than the 80th percentile of low-income people and then capping other SUA components as well.   The proposed rule merely asserts that it calculated calibrating to the 50th percentile compared to the 80th percentile.  The proposed rule does not adequately explain whether USDA analyzed impacts calibrated to the 85th or higher percentiles and what the results of those estimates were.   The lack of such explanation is particularly concerning given research documented that 21 states had SUAs exceeding the 85th percentile estimates, possibly because in their efforts to mitigate benefit loss for households with very high utility costs. 

The Administration concedes that the proposed rule would cause 19 percent of SNAP households to get lower SNAP monthly benefits, would disproportionately impact elderly people and people with disabilities, and would cause a national net cut to SNAP benefits amounting to $4.5 billion over five years.

I live in Phoenix, Arizona where it is extremely hot causing very high electricity bills. At the age of 50 I was blind-sided when my husband left with a  five- minute warning. I was attending Arizona State University to get my Bachelor's Degree and was not  working. I took a few weeks before I realized I might qualify. I had never been on assistance in my life. I was given about $190 per month. That was enough to get one person through a month who shopped carefully at places like Winco Foods and used coupons for desired items. I was able to buy the healthy food I like compared to what I got at the food bank. One time I left the food bank with not much more than two containers of ice cream and two large packages of Oreos!  That is not the way a person who is at high risk for diabetes, heart disease, and stroke should be eating. When sweeping cuts are made, you don't know who you"

Dear Sec. Perdue,



SNAPs statutory purpose, as declared by Congress, is to promote the general welfare, to safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation's population by raising levels of nutrition among low-income households. Therefore, the USDA must help preserve the essential mission of SNAP by rejecting the rule up for consideration to cut $4.5 billion in funds from SNAP over 5 years from low-income families who need it most by undermining the ability of each state to determine the factors and utility costs they are using to determine eligibility. 



Current policy recognizes that utility costs vary throughout the U.S. and allows flexibility in how states calculate those costs. Under current law, SNAP takes into account the utility expenses of each SNAP household. States adjust household benefits based on a state-specific SUA/Standard Utility Allowance calculated by the state and approved by USDA.   The proposed USDA rule takes this flexibility from the states and, as a result, cuts the food aid millions of families would receive, substantially cutting essential benefits for 7 million Americans. This new USDA rule is flawed and must be rejected.



Far too many Americans in this Western democracy struggle with poverty, food insecurity, a poor diet and obesity. Research shows SNAP alleviates these problems and improves the health and well-being of millions of people across our country. Improving SNAP benefits would further increase the effectiveness of this program. 



Each state must be allowed to account for the costs of utilities as they calculate SNAP benefits. This new USDA rule proposal unfairly standardizes and caps Standard Utility Allowance calculations across the U.S. based on inadequate survey data resulting in dramatic cuts to food stamps. This rule change would exacerbate the struggles of millions of low-income Americans.

Dear SNAP Certification Policy Branch:

I appreciate the opportunity to comment on USDA's Notice of Proposed Rule regarding Supplemental Assistance Nutrition Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances. According to the Department's own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years.

I volunteer with Jewish Family Service Pollack Food Bank in the central core of the city of Seattle, Washington. Despite the technology-fueled boom of prosperity routinely illustrated by the media, the success of Seattle is not equally shared. The Pollack Food Bank covers some of the wealthiest zip codes in the city, yet each day we are open, we are often overwhelmed by the need of our neighbors. The escalating costs of living in Seattle are obviously most acutely felt by those who are already confronting the challenges of housing and job security due to age, physical limitations or the lack of affordable childcare in this city. Our food bank runs out of food before we ever run out of people in need who wait for hours in our famously miserable weather, many using mobility assistance devices or have small children and infants. I see the very real need for food assistance. It isn't through data tables or spreadsheets; I see it in the faces of people who struggle to meet one of the most fundamental needs of humanity. I see the college student, first in their family to enroll in secondary education, who now chooses between lab fees or lunch. The elderly Russian immigrant who profusely thanks us for every small item they receive. I know these people, I know their names and their children's names - they are Evelyn, whose husband had a stroke while battling cancer, Jade, a young mother of two trying to get her GED, Exiquio, who works in call center, but at minimum wage cannot afford to feed his family, Jolanta, who survived persecution as a Jew in the Soviet Union and has a disabled daughter. These people are not lazy, they are not deadbeats, they are not trying to scam the system. They work hard to survive. They just need a small bit of help to overcome their challenges, challenges which are not unique, not due to an infraction on their part, challenges which could have occurred in anyone's life. When you have access to resources, very few events are insurmountable. Yet far too many people believe that we all have access to the same resources or that in order for us to have access and to succeed, someone else must go without. I cannot even begin to comprehend such beliefs. I cannot begin to comprehend public policy which makes manifest such inequality. I cannot comprehend public policy which denies basic humanity, and which actively discourages the best and most successful outcome for everyone. What possible gain can such policy achieve - there are not words available to explain why we should endeavor to create an exclusionary and inhumane society. 

In Washington State, children and the elderly are the most affected, making up over 50 percent of the people utilizing the emergency food system. . They are not just those experiencing homelessness; they are working poor, households headed by women, families suffering crises such as a layoff, medical emergency or domestic abuse. Local food security agencies have provided the following data:
 1 in 10 Washingtonians struggle with hunger.
 1 in 6 Washington kids live in a household that faces challenges in putting enough food on the table.
 1 in 8 Washingtonians live below the poverty line.
 1 in 8 Washingtonians relies on SNAP (food stamps), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Half of all people on SNAP are kids.
 The majority of working-age Washingtonians living in poverty are working or actively looking for work. Many work more than one job.
 Washington state ranks 10th in the country in overall wealth - and ranks 34th in food insecurity.

09000064841b20a9,82,102,1,713,"On behalf of Little Rivers Health Care, Federally Qualified Health Center we appreciate the opportunity to comment on USDA's Notice of Proposed Rule regarding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances. According to the Department's own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years.

The proposed changes would exacerbate the struggles many low-income people already face in paying for both heat and utilities. This harm will be felt acutely in Vermont, where heating costs are especially high. It would cause serious harm to Vermonters living in our already isolated and rural towns, our community and the nation. The proposed rule will have a lasting and devastating impact on our families and should be withdrawn. 
 
SNAP (known in Vermont as 3SquaresVT) plays a critical role in addressing hunger and food insecurity in Vermont. For over 40 years, SNAP has been our nation's first line of defense against hunger, because it works. It provides, on average, over 70,000 Vermonters and 40 million Americans with money to spend on food in grocery stores and farmers markets each month. It is proven to reduce hunger, lift people out of poverty, and leads to positive short and long-term health, education, and employment outcomes. 
 
Policymakers recognize that household resources needed to pay for basics such as shelter, utility costs and childcare are not available to purchase food. That is why under current law, SNAP takes into account the utility expenses of each SNAP household. States adjust household benefits based on a state-specific Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) calculated by the state and approved by USDA. The current policy allows variances in SUAs to accommodate for differences in utility costs and rates, and allows states flexibility in how they calculate those costs. This is especially important in a state like Vermont, where heating costs are much higher than in other parts of the country.
The proposed rule would standardize and cap SUA calculations across the country based on survey data, but does not contain an adequate explanation of USDA's rationale for the methodology or reasoning behind this strategy or its accuracy. One thing is clear: the proposed rule would cause 19 percent of SNAP households to get lower SNAP monthly benefits, would disproportionately impact elderly people and people with disabilities, and would cause a national net cut to SNAP benefits amounting to $4.5 billion over five years. 
In Vermont, the impact of this proposal would be even more devastating, and only serve to increase hunger in our state and worsen the benefits cliff for thousands of Vermont families working to put enough food on the table for themselves and their families. According to estimates from Vermont's Department for Children and Families, this proposal would cause 68 percent of Vermont households to lose an average of $82 per month in benefits. This equates to over 26,000 Vermont households, and would mean a loss of over $25 million per year to Vermont's food economy. Additionally, 80 percent of 3SquaresVT households with an older adult or Vermonter with a disability would see a cut in their benefits. This is unacceptable in my community.
This USDA rulemaking is yet another attempt for the Administration to side step Congress and make cuts to SNAP benefits. Congress reviewed SNAP policy during the 2018 Farm Bill, including the fact that states have options that may produce differences in SNAP eligibility benefit amounts from state to state. Although the President's FY 2019 Budget included a request for a change similar to the proposed rule [https://www.obpa.usda.gov/32fns2019notes.pdf], Congress did not include such a change in the 2018 Farm Bill. Indeed, evening out benefit amounts across states by lowering benefits for large numbers of participants does not promote SNAP's statutory purpose, but rather directly undermines and seeks to weaken it.
USDA should be strengthening the positive impacts of SNAP for health, well-being and economic activity, not making cuts to SNAP benefits. Little Rivers Health Care strongly oppose the proposed rule and request the USDA withdraw the rule and work with states to improve their SUA's under existing flexibility.

The real issue is that millions of Americans and thousands of Vermonters are struggling to make ends meet and aren't able to access enough food to grow, learn, and stay healthy. Instead of proposing severe cuts to programs like SNAP, the Trump administration should be working to increase wages and improve access to housing, health care, and food assistance.

We strongly oppose the proposed rule that would cut food benefits for struggling people and harm our community. Instead, We request that USDA withdraw this rule and work with states to improve their SUA's under existing flexibility.

According to the Departments own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years.
The proposed changes would exacerbate the struggles many low-income people already face in paying for both heat and utilities. Our home state of Vermont stands to suffer the most severe consequences of any other state, as heating costs in Vermont are especially high. It would cause serious harm to Vermonters, particularly older Vermonters and those living with disabilities, our community, and the nation. The proposed rule is flawed and should be withdrawn.
 Our Co-op is community-owned by over 5,500 member-owner households in this community and roughly 4.5% of our member-owners are part of our Food For All program, which means that they rely on assistance programs to keep food on the table. We choose to subsidize their member-ownership in the Co-op and extend an extra 10% discount on all purchases to help make their grocery budget stretch a little further in an effort to alleviate food insecurity in our community and increase access to healthy foods. Cutting their benefits would mean that wed have a stronger need in our community, but would see fewer of these families for shopping trips due to their diminished resources available for purchasing food, hurting both our community-owned store and the families that depend on it as a source for healthy local food. 
Our Co-op also works with over 300 local farmers and food producers to keep our shelves stocked. These proposed cuts would remove $26 million annually from Vermonts food economy, which would hurt these hardworking farmers and food producers and hurt independent retailers who provide outlets for the products grown and produced by these individuals.  Vermont is a state that is well-known for its vibrant local food economy and many families in our state derive income from being a part of the food economy in some way. Choosing to remove $26 million per year from the local food economy would have devastating effects on all of these families and businesses. 
SNAP (known in Vermont as 3SquaresVT) plays a critical role in addressing hunger and food insecurity in Vermont. For over 40 years, SNAP has been our nations first line of defense against hunger, because it works.

It is proven to reduce hunger, lift people out of poverty, and leads to positive short and long-term health, education, and employment outcomes.
A significant number of families in our community rely on this program to keep food on their table. The proposed cuts would remove an average of $82 per month in benefits for 68% of 3SquaresVt households. Thats over 3 in 5 households that would no longer have the means to provide adequate nourishment to meet daily needs. This proposed rule would cut 3SquaresVT benefits for 80% of households with an older Vermonter or a person with a disability. These are members of our community that are unable to be a productive part of the workforce and thus rely on these programs for survival. These individuals should not have to choose between buying the medications they need and putting food on the table. They should not have to choose between heating their home and putting food on the table. The proposed cuts to the 3SquaresVT program would make this decision a daily reality for these families. 
The proposed rule would standardize and cap SUA calculations across the country based on survey data but does not contain an adequate explanation of USDAs rationale for the methodology or reasoning behind this strategy or its accuracy. One thing is clear: the proposed rule would cause 19 percent of SNAP households to get lower SNAP monthly benefits, would disproportionately impact elderly people and people with disabilities and would cause a national net cut to SNAP benefits amounting to $4.5 billion over five years.

SNAPs statutory purpose, as declared by Congress, is to promote the general welfare, to safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation's population by raising levels of nutrition among low-income households.""  SNAP's mechanism for achieving that purpose is to increase the food-purchasing power of low-income households, thereby strengthening the demand for the products produced by the nation's agricultural sector.

SNAP plays a critical role in addressing hunger and food insecurity in our community. It is the first line of defense against hunger for low-income residents.  SNAP benefits respond quickly and effectively to changes in need, whether due to economic downturns, personal life events, or natural disasters.

According to recent studies, it is estimated that $1 of SNAP benefits leads to between $1.50 and $1.80 in total economic activity during a recession. [See The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Economy:  New Estimates of the SNAP Multiplier, USDA Economic Research Service, July 2019, available at https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/93529/err-265.pdf?v=8010.7 pages 6-8 and Table 1 (regarding research by Blinder and Zandi)]

States adjust household benefits based on a state-specific Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) calculated by the state and approved by USDA. The current policy allows variances in SUAs to accommodate for differences in utility costs and rates, and allows states flexibility in how they calculate those costs. 

The proposed rule would standardize and cap SUA calculations across the country based on survey data. The proposed rule does not adequately explain USDAs rationale for doing this.   The proposed rule merely asserts that it calculated calibrating to the 50th percentile compared to the 80th percentile. Further explanation and justification is necessary, given research that documented that 21 states had SUAs exceeding the 85th percentile estimates, presumably in their efforts to mitigate benefit loss for households with very high utility costs.
Connecticut is a state with higher than average utility costs, and therefore Connecticut residents would be disadvantaged by a rule that requires the state to use a nationwide average utility cost when calculating household resources that are available to buy food.

The Administration concedes that the proposed rule would cause 19 percent of SNAP households to get lower SNAP monthly benefits, would disproportionately impact elderly people and people with disabilities, and would cause a national net cut to SNAP benefits amounting to $4.5 billion over five years.

The USDA's proposed rule on SNAP Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances is a misguided and dangerous proposal that would cut program benefits by a total of $4.5 billion over five years, by changing how states account for household utility costs in determining the household's level of SNAP benefits. This amounts to forcing millions of low-income families to choose between ""heating and eating"" and is especially mean-spirited as we enter the winter months. The Americans who stand to lose from this proposed rule are individuals and families who are working diligently to contribute to their communities, care for their loved ones, and stay healthy, while covering their bills and keeping the heat on. Cutting SNAP benefits for these individuals and families would be a gross failure of our government to support and encourage its hard-working, low-income people, and, worse, would pose direct threats to health and well-being. What kind of country treats its own people like this? It is shameful for the most powerful and well-resourced nation in the world to allow hard-working Americans and their families to suffer.

In addition to the above, the school lunch program should not be cut in any way either.  School lunches, Friday food backpacks for children to take home for the weekend, and summer food programs should not be cut, as these programs provide ways to reduce food insecurity in low-income communities where for various reasons children don't get enough to eat.

Thank you for your consideration."

This will make life harder for millions of hardworking Americans who are already struggling to put food on their tables. I work with many people experiencing food insecurity every day and this will be another blow to their survival. SNAP is not just a great program that helps people rise out of poverty, numerous research has shown that it is good for the economy. And when our citizens are food secure and healthy, our health costs are lower and we do better as a country. But most importantly, it's about our values. What does it say about a country that tries to take food away from millions of hungry people, especially a country that is the richest and most powerful in the world? This rule will impact the most vulnerable, including elderly people and people with disabilities.

Re:  Notice of Proposed Rule Making Regarding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances -- RIN 0584-AE69
 
Dear SNAP Program Design Branch:
 
I appreciate the opportunity to comment on USDA's Notice of Proposed Rule regarding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances. According to the Department's own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years.

The proposed changes would exacerbate the struggles many low-income people already face in paying for both heat and utilities. This harm would be felt acutely in Vermont, where heating costs are especially high. It would cause serious harm to Vermonters  our community and the nation. The proposed rule is flaws and should be withdrawn.
 
SNAP (known in Vermont as 3SquaresVT) plays a critical role in addressing hunger and food insecurity in Vermont. For over 40 years, SNAP has been our nation's first line of defense against hunger, because it works. It provides, on average, over 70,000 Vermonters and 40 million Americans with money to spend on food in grocery stores and farmers markets each month. It is proven to reduce hunger, lift people out of poverty, and leads to positive short and long-term health, education, and employment outcomes. 
 
Policymakers recognize that household resources needed to pay for basics such as shelter, utility costs and childcare are not available to purchase food. That is why under current law, SNAP takes into account the utility expenses of each SNAP household. States adjust household benefits based on a state-specific Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) calculated by the state and approved by USDA. The current policy allows variances in SUAs to accommodate for differences in utility costs and rates, and allows states flexibility in how they calculate those costs. This is especially important in a state like Vermont, where heating costs are much higher than in other parts of the country.
The proposed rule would standardize and cap SUA calculations across the country based on survey data, but does not contain an adequate explanation of USDA's rationale for the methodology or reasoning behind this strategy or its accuracy. One thing is clear: the proposed rule would cause 19 percent of SNAP households to get lower SNAP monthly benefits, would disproportionately impact elderly people and people with disabilities, and would cause a national net cut to SNAP benefits amounting to $4.5 billion over five years. 
In Vermont, the impact of this proposal would be even more devastating, and only serve to increase hunger in our state and worsen the benefits cliff for thousands of Vermont families working to put enough food on the table for themselves and their families. According to estimates from Vermont's Department for Children and Families, this proposal would cause 68 percent of Vermont households to lose an average of $82 per month in benefits. This equates to over 26,000 Vermont households, and would mean a loss of over $25 million per year to Vermont's food economy. Additionally, 80 percent of 3SquaresVT households with an older adult or Vermonter with a disability would see a cut in their benefits. This is unacceptable in my community.

 I strongly oppose the proposed rule that would cut food benefits for struggling people and harm our community. Instead. I request that USDA withdraw this rule and work with states to improve their SUA's under existing flexibility.
 
Sincerely,

Dear SNAP Program Design Branch:
 
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on USDAs Notice of Proposed Rule regarding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances. According to the Departments own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years. I want to voice my strong opposition to this proposal; if it goes into effect, this will cause serious harm to Vermonters in my community, as well as people across the country. The proposed rule should be withdrawn.

3SquaresVT (our states name for SNAP) is Vermonts first line of defense against hunger. It helps Vermonters afford enough food for themselves and their families, pulls people out of poverty, helps people learn and find and keep jobs, and improves health, both in the short term and in the long term. At Mercy Connections, we run the Vermont Womens Mentoring Program which matches volunteer women mentors to incarcerated women mentees in re-entry to community. Virtually every mentee is struggling to find work or training for work, affordable housing and food to establish their basic needs and not return to jail. They would be extremely hard-hit by this proposed cut to their 3Squares VT assistance and at greater risk of recidivism as a result.

According to estimates from Vermonts Department for Children and Families (the agency that administers 3SquaresVT), this rule would mean that 26,000 Vermont households would receive a cut in their 3SquaresVT benefits, on average losing $82 per month for food; thats over 3 in 5 3SquaresVT households. It would harm older Vermonters and people with disabilities at an even higher rate; 80 percent of these households would receive a cut. Additionally, with nearly $26 million fewer dollars per year coming into our state to help people in need buy more and better food, our local retailers and state economy would be harmed. This is unacceptable in my community. Most mentees in the VT Womens Mentoring Program are also young, unmarried mothers. These proposed cuts could be absolutely devastating to the health of their young children, most of whom they are struggling to keep and with whom they seek to establish a nurturing, healthy relationship.

In a rural and cold-weather state like Vermont, people who struggle to make ends meet have a lot of obstacles to overcome. Especially at this time of year, it is cruel and misguided to attempt to weaken a program that is proven to help people buy more and better food. Please dont make accessing food even harder for the thousands of Vermonters and millions of Americans working hard to stay healthy while covering their bills and keeping the heat on. Instead of proposing to cut 3SquaresVT, I urge you to work to increase wages and improve access to housing, healthcare, and food assistance programs like 3SquaresVT. They make a huge difference in the lives of low-income Vermonters and the health of our state as a whole, and should remain strong and accessible.

Re:  Notice of Proposed Rule Making Regarding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances -- RIN 0584-AE69
 
Dear SNAP Program Design Branch:
 
On behalf of Capstone Community Action, serving the rural communities of Central Vermont, we appreciate the opportunity to comment on USDA's Notice of Proposed Rule regarding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances. 

SNAP (known in Vermont as 3SquaresVT) plays a critical role in addressing hunger and food insecurity in Vermont. For over 40 years, SNAP has been our nation's first line of defense against hunger, because it works. It provides, on average, over 70,000 Vermonters and 40 million Americans with money to spend on food in grocery stores and farmers markets each month. It is proven to reduce hunger, lift people out of poverty, and leads to positive short and long-term health, education, and employment outcomes. 

	The proposed rule, reducing access to SNAP, is flawed and should be withdrawn.
 
The proposed changes would exacerbate the struggles many low-income people already face in paying for housing, heat, and utilities. According to the Department's own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years. This harm would be felt acutely in Vermont, where heating and food costs are especially high. It would cause serious harm to the Vermonters we serve in Lamoille, Washington, Orange & Northern Windsor counties where, according to data from 2016, 12,052 of our community members live below the Federal Poverty Level.  The proposal would be most problematic for our youngest and most vulnerable Vermonters, our children. According to the American Community Survey 5-year data, an average of 20.3% of the children in our community live below the federal poverty level.  

Capstone Community Action helps stabilize families in economic crisis by working to meet their basic needs for food, shelter and heat.  We help them access tools to rise beyond poverty through a wide array of services, including: weatherization services to reduce and control future utility costs in their homes; financial empowerment initiatives to help them establish credit, build assets, start businesses, and understand how to make their money work for them; by providing education and training for future employment options; Head Start & Early Head Start programming, giving children a strong foundation so they can succeed in school and in life. 
 
Yet, in order for our community to succeed, our people need to be able to access sufficient healthy foods.  The proposed rule would standardize and cap SUA calculations across the country based on survey data, but does not contain an adequate explanation of USDA's rationale for the methodology or reasoning behind this strategy or its accuracy. One thing is clear: the proposed rule would cause 19 percent of SNAP households to get lower SNAP monthly benefits, would disproportionately impact elderly people and people with disabilities, and would cause a national net cut to SNAP benefits amounting to $4.5 billion over five years. 

In Vermont, the impact of this proposal would be even more devastating, causing 68 % of Vermont households to lose an average of $82 per month in benefits. This equates to over 26,000 Vermont households, and would mean a loss of over $25 million per year to Vermont's food economy. Additionally, 80 % of SNAP households with an older adult or Vermonter with a disability would see a cut in their benefits. This is unacceptable for our community.

Take the example of Jeana, a single mother with a disabled son. ""Without my 3Squares benefits I would struggle. Without free lunch at school, he wouldn't have lunch at school.  Because of the SNAP benefits I am able to keep a roof over our heads.  It means my Reach Up benefit and my son's SSI can go toward rent and keeping our lights on.""

Millions of Americans and thousands of Vermonters are struggling to make ends meet and aren't able to access enough food to grow, learn, and stay healthy. 

We strongly oppose the proposed rule that would cut food benefits for struggling people and harm our community. Instead, we request that USDA withdraw this rule and work with states to improve their SUA's under existing flexibility.

Dear SNAP Program Design Branch:
 
On behalf of Allegheny Health Network's Healthy Food Centers appreciate the opportunity to comment on USDA's Notice of Proposed Rule regarding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances. According to the Department's own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years.

The proposed changes would exacerbate the struggles many low-income people already face in paying for both heat and utilities. This harm would be felt acutely in Vermont, where heating costs are especially high. It would cause serious harm to Vermonters and our own Allegheny County residents in our community and the nation. The proposed rule is flaws and should be withdrawn.

Allegheny Health Network, in western Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh) has recently implemented Healthy Food Centers in the hospitals. Pittsburgh has a large food insecure population and a many of the residents live in food desserts. In Allegheny County alone, one in seven people experience food insecurity, 21.4% or 1 in 5 Pittsburgh residents are food insecure. There is growing acknowledgement in the health care community that health outcomes and disparities are more often driven by social determinants of health than by medical care. Food insecurity -- a primary social determinant -- is associated with some of the most serious and costly chronic health problems in the nation: hypertension, CHD, hepatitis, stroke, cancer, asthma, diabetes, arthritis, COPD, and kidney disease. One out of three chronically ill adults is unable to afford medicine, food, or both. The implications for national health care costs are staggering and resulted in direct and indirect health-related costs estimated to be $160 billion in 2014 alone.

The Healthy Food Center strives improve health and overall well-being by providing access to healthy nutritious food choices, nutrition education, and support to the food insecure population in a healthcare setting. The Healthy Food Center is program under the Center for Inclusion Health serving the socially marginalized and underserved populations, such as the food insecure population. At no cost, we provide nutritious food choices, disease based education, and assistance with wrap around services, such as SNAP applications. We collaborate significantly with community partners to help lift our efforts, such as, the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank for our healthy inventory, Gateway Health for kitchen utensils, The Food Trust for fresh produce coupons, and Traveler's Aid for transportation services. We solely identify our clients through screening questions with no income requirements. We help to bridge the meal gap between federal assistance guidelines and individuals who may not meet the requirements. We also offer one on one nutrition counseling, healthy recipes, and cooking classes.


SNAP (known in Vermont as 3SquaresVT) plays a critical role in addressing hunger and food insecurity in Vermont. For over 40 years, SNAP has been our nation's first line of defense against hunger, because it works. It provides, on average, over 70,000 Vermonters and 40 million Americans with money to spend on food in grocery stores and farmers markets each month. It is proven to reduce hunger, lift people out of poverty, and leads to positive short and long-term health, education, and employment outcomes. 
 
Because of SNAP in collaboration with our Healthy Food Center services, not only are our patients able to have food on the table, many of them have been introduced to new types of vegetables that they have never prepared or eaten before. We have seen patients improve their blood sugar management, blood pressure, body weight, and overall health. The produce that you helped us provide has directly improved the lives of our patients.

This USDA rulemaking is yet another attempt for the Administration to side step Congress and make cuts to SNAP benefits. Congress reviewed SNAP policy during the 2018 Farm Bill, including the fact that states have options that may produce differences in SNAP eligibility benefit amounts from state to state. Although the President's FY 2019 Budget included a request for a change similar to the proposed rule https://www.obpa.usda.gov/32fns2019notes.pdf, Congress did not include such a change in the 2018 Farm Bill. Indeed, evening out benefit amounts across states by lowering benefits for large numbers of participants does not promote SNAP's statutory purpose, but rather directly undermines and seeks to weaken it.
USDA should be strengthening the positive impacts of SNAP for health, well-being and economic activity, not making cuts to SNAP benefits. We strongly oppose the proposed rule, and request the USDA withdraw the rule and work with states to improve their SUA's un"

Re:  Notice of Proposed Rule Making Regarding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances -- RIN 0584-AE69 


Dear SNAP Certification Policy Branch:

I appreciate the opportunity to comment on USDAs Notice of Proposed Rule regarding Supplemental Assistance Nutrition Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances. 

The proposed rule, estimated to cut benefits by $4.5 billion in SNAP benefits over five years, would force an increasing number of low-income individuals to choose between providing food for their families, or essential utilities like heat.  It would have harmful impacts on health and well-being, as well as on the economy as a whole. The proposed rule is flawed and should be withdrawn.
 
SNAPs statutory purpose, as declared by Congress, is to promote the general welfare, to safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation's population by raising levels of nutrition among low-income households. Congress finds that the limited food purchasing power of low-income households contributes to hunger and malnutrition among members of such households. Congress further finds that increased utilization of food in establishing and maintaining adequate national levels of nutrition will promote the distribution in a beneficial manner of the Nation's agricultural abundance and will strengthen the Nation's agricultural economy, as well as result in more orderly marketing and distribution of foods. To alleviate such hunger and malnutrition, a supplemental nutrition assistance program is herein authorized which will permit low-income households to obtain a more nutritious diet through normal channels of trade by increasing food purchasing power for all eligible households who apply for participation. 

I have worked in several positions where Ive witnessed firsthand the critical role that SNAP plays in addressing hunger and food insecurity, specifically in Massachusetts and in North Carolina. This includes time with the Asheville-Buncombe Food Policy Council where I worked to increase the utilization of SNAP at farmers markets, a job in the front office of a public school, where I worked closely with families receiving SNAP benefits, and in my current position at the Greater Boston Food Bank. While it is consistent that low-income people will be faced with making the choice between shelter, utilities, medical costs, childcare, and food, these costs are certainly not consistent across the two states I have lived and worked in. 

Currently, the utility expenses of each SNAP household are taken into account and states adjust benefits based on a state-specific Standard Utility Allowance (SUA). The current policy allows variances in SUAs to accommodate for differences in utility costs and rates, and allows states flexibility in how costs are calculated. It is commonly known that Massachusetts has some of the highest housing, food and childcare costs in the United States. While individuals and families in both states will need to navigate these costs with limited resources, the SUA for someone living in North Carolina will not be equivalent to that of someone living in Massachusetts.  

Standardizing benefit amounts across the country by lowering benefits for many does not promote SNAPs statutory purpose as quoted above. Older adults and people with disabilities will be disparately impacted by the proposed rule, and the purchasing power of SNAP households will decrease. 

Finally, the proposed rule does not adequately explain USDAs rationale for capping the largest of the SUA components by calibrating to utility expense survey data for those no higher than the 80th percentile of low-income people. The proposed rule does not adequately explain whether USDA analyzed impacts calibrated to the 85th or higher percentiles and what the results of those estimates were.  The lack of such explanation is particularly concerning given research documented that 21 states had SUAs exceeding the 85th percentile estimates. 

USDA should be strengthening the positive impacts of SNAP for health, well-being and economic activity, not making cuts to the program.  I strongly oppose this rule and request that it be withdrawn.

Re:  Notice of Proposed Rule Making Regarding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances -- RIN 0584-AE69 

Dear SNAP Certification Policy Branch:

On behalf of Long Island Cares, Inc.The Harry Chapin Food Bank, I appreciate the opportunity to comment on USDA's Notice of Proposed Rule regarding Supplemental Assistance Nutrition Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances which by USDA's own admission would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over the next five years. 

Congress realizes that people in need have a very difficult time paying the high and rising costs associated with basic necessities, such as, shelter, utilities, and childcare.  In many cases, struggling Americans are faced with the daunting choice of paying their utility bill or buying food.  This is why the current law allows states to factor in utility expenses when calculating SNAP benefit levels.  Each state is currently permitted to adjust household benefits based upon a state-specific Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) which must be approved by USDA.  This policy allows for variances in SUAs to account for factors, such as differences in utility costs and rates, which tend to vary greatly throughout the nation.  However, this proposed rule would utilize survey data to standardize and cap SUA calculations.   

This new methodology is flawed and hurts low-income Americans in many ways.  First, this proposed rule does not adequately explain USDA's rationale for capping the largest of the SUA components by calibrating to utility expense survey data for those no higher than the 80th percentile of low-income people.  The proposed rule merely asserts that it calculated calibrating to the 50th percentile compared to the 80th percentile.  Furthermore, the rule does not adequately address whether USDA analyzed the true impact these new calibrations would have upon low income households struggling to get by in America.  This lack of documented clarity is particularly concerning given that there are currently 21 states with SUAs already exceeding the 85th percentile in an attempt to mitigate benefit loss for households in states, like New York, with very high utility costs.  The Trump Administration and USDA acknowledge that this rule would cause 19 percent of SNAP households to receive lower monthly benefits, disproportionately impact the elderly and people with disabilities, and cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over the five years.  This shortsighted rule has the potential to negatively impact 144,000 Long Islanders relying upon SNAP benefits to put food on the table for themselves and their families.  Many of these people are also accessing the services of their regional food bank, Long Island Cares, Inc., and we fear that an increase of this magnitude would place an undue burden on the nation's food banks, who without increased federal support would not have the resources to step in and fill these new gaps.   

This new USDA rulemaking is another attempt by the Administration to sidestep Congress and make severe SNAP cuts.  During the 2018 Farm Bill negotiations, Congress reviewed SNAP policy, including the provisions relating to states having the option to produce differences in SNAP eligibility based upon the differences in regional cost of living expenses.  Last year, the President's FY 2019 Budget included a request very similar to this proposed rulemaking, but Congress decided not to enact such a change in the final version of the 2018 Farm Bill.  

Long Island Cares is proud to stand with hunger advocates such as Feeding America and the Food Research and Action Center (FRAC) in encouraging USDA to take steps to strengthen SNAP, and to cease circumventing Congress in repeated attempts to restructure the program in ways that produce dramatic benefit cuts.  Long Island Cares, Inc.The Harry Chapin Food Bank is proud to go on record in staunch opposition to this proposed rule, and we respectfully request that USDA immediately withdraws this rule and instead seeks input from the states on how to best improve their current SUAs under the flexibility provided by the current rules.

Dear SNAP Certification Policy Branch:

On behalf of Slow Food California and our 20+ local chapters statewide, we appreciate the opportunity to comment on USDAs Notice of Proposed Rule regarding Supplemental Assistance Nutrition Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances. According to the Departments own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years. Slow Food California finds this unacceptable.

The proposed rule would exacerbate the struggles many low-income people in our state have paying for costs of both food and utilities. It would have harmful impacts on health and well-being as well as on the economy. The proposed rule is seriously flawed and should be withdrawn.
 
Slow Food California supports good, clean, and fair food for all. We support eradicating hunger and minimizing food insecurity.  SNAP plays a critical role in addressing hunger and food insecurity across our state and in our local chapters. It is the first line of defense against hunger for low-income residents. SNAP benefits respond quickly and effectively to changes in need, whether due to economic downturns or natural disasters. According to recent studies, it is estimated that $1 of SNAP benefits leads to between $1.50 and $1.80 in total economic activity during a recession.  Policymakers recognize that household resources needed to pay for basics such as shelter, utility costs and childcare are not available to purchase food. Under current law, SNAP takes into account the utility expenses of each SNAP household. States adjust household benefits based on a state-specific Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) calculated by the state and approved by USDA. The current policy allows variances in SUAs to accommodate for differences in utility costs and rates, and allows states flexibility in how they calculate those costs. The proposed rule does away with that flexibility.

USDA should be strengthening the positive impacts of SNAP for health, well- being and economic activity, not making cuts to SNAP benefits. Slow Food California strongly opposes the proposed rule and request the USDA withdraw the rule and work with states to improve their SUAs under existing flexibility.

Sincerely and on behalf of Slow Food California,

Re:  Notice of Proposed Rule Making Regarding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances -- RIN 0584-AE69
 
Dear SNAP Program Design Branch:
 
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on USDA's Notice of Proposed Rule regarding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances. According to the Department's own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years. I want to voice my strong opposition to this proposal; if it goes into effect, this will cause serious harm to Vermonters in my community, as well as people across the country. The proposed rule should be withdrawn.

3SquaresVT (our state's name for SNAP) is Vermont's first line of defense against hunger. It helps Vermonters afford enough food for themselves and their families, pulls people out of poverty, helps people learn and find and keep jobs, and improves health, both in the short term and in the long term. I work with the elderly and their families. I see many people trying to live on less than $1000 per month per person in income...here in Vermont...that doesn't work when you have property taxes, fuel, homeowners ins., and utilities. This didn't even take a vehicle into consideration, which we all need in rural Vermont. Now the little bit of breath they could take was knowing they qualified for $194/month in food assistance...try eating yourself for less than that...you can't do that and maintain lower blood sugars, low cholesterol, and or low blood pressures. These people raised our communities and didn't have programs just sitting out there to be used, they worked hard for everything. Many of them are still struggling with part-time jobs just to make ends meet. If any group in our small little state needs a break it's our elderly.  

According to estimates from Vermont's Department for Children and Families (the agency that administers 3SquaresVT), this rule would mean that 26,000 Vermont households would receive a cut in their 3SquaresVT benefits, on average losing $82 per month for food; that's over 3 in 5 3SquaresVT households. It would harm older Vermonters and people with disabilities at an even higher rate; 80 percent of these households would receive a cut. Additionally, with nearly $26 million fewer dollars per year coming into our state to help people in need buy more and better food, our local retailers and state economy would be harmed. This is unacceptable in my community. $82 per month may not sound like much to you; but to an older person that is how this breaks down as to what they now cannot afford:
$16/month 4 gallons of milk at $3.99/gal (one gallon per 7 day week)
$19/month 4 lb of hamburger at $4.75/lb 91%lean (one pound of burger per 7 day week)
$14/month 4 lbs of chicken breast at $3.50/lb boneless (one pound of chicken per 7 day week)
$8/month 4 loafs of bread at $2/loaf (one loaf of bread over a 7 day week)
$25 fruits and vegetables do we need to take these out of their mouths too??? Our seniors should not worry if they can afford fresh fruits, meats, and dairy. Our seniors have the largest health concerns around diets. If we are trying to heal or maintain the health of our elderly then we must meet their dietary requirements and not make them choose if they can afford a healthy diet. 

In a rural and cold-weather state like Vermont, people who struggle to make ends meet have a lot of obstacles to overcome. Especially at this time of year, it is cruel and misguided to attempt to weaken a program that is proven to help people buy more and better food. Please don't make accessing food even harder for the thousands of Vermonters and millions of Americans working hard to stay healthy while covering their bills and keeping the heat on. Instead of proposing to cut 3SquaresVT, I urge you to work to increase wages and improve access to housing, healthcare, and food assistance programs like 3SquaresVT. They make a huge difference in the lives of low-income Vermonters and the health of our state as a whole, and should remain strong and accessible.

Dear SNAP Certification Policy Branch:

On behalf of the Upper Valley Haven, I appreciate the opportunity to comment on USDA's Notice of Proposed Rule regarding Supplemental Assistance Nutrition Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances. According to the Department's own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years.

The proposed rule would exacerbate the struggles many low-income people have paying for costs of both food and utilities.  It would have harmful impacts on health and well-being as well as on the economy. The proposed rule is flawed and should be withdrawn.

The Upper Valley Haven, where I am the Executive Director, is keenly aware of the challenges of food insecurity experienced by people who have low incomes. We provide the second largest food shelf in the state of Vermont serving over 12,000 of friends and neighbors in this community. 

Hunger is a problem in Vermont. Over 59 thousand Vermonters live in food insecure households, meaning they don't have regular access to nutritious food. This is 10% of the total population. Seventeen thousand Vermont children (15%) under the age of 18 live in food insecure households (15%) Food insecurity also disproportionately affects seniors.

SNAP plays a critical role in addressing hunger and food insecurity in our community. It is the first line of defense against hunger for low-income residents. 

The proposed rule change in how states take households' utility costs into consideration when determining the amount of benefits households receive will have devastating effects.

If enacted, this rule would:

 Cut an average of $82 per month in benefits for 68% of 3SquaresVT households.
 Cut 3SquaresVT benefits for 80% of households with an older Vermonter or person with a disability.
 Remove nearly $26 million per year from Vermont's food economy. This new proposal would hurt Vermont more than any other state

The Administration concedes that the proposed rule would cause 19 percent of SNAP households to get lower SNAP monthly benefits, would disproportionately impact elderly people and people with disabilities, and would cause a national net cut to SNAP benefits amounting to $4.5 billion over five years.

The food security and health implications of the proposed rule are serious and disturbing.  Food insecurity has direct and indirect impacts on physical and mental health for people of all ages. Food insecurity  and even marginal food security (a less severe level of food insecurity) is especially detrimental to the health, development, and well-being of infants, children, and adolescents. 
SNAP plays a critical role in improving the food security, health, and well-being of program participants across the lifespan.
Older adults and people with disabilities will be disparately impacted by the proposed rule.  SNAP plays an important role in supporting the food security, nutrition, and health of older adults, allowing them to maintain their independence while also reducing their health care utilization and costs.  People with disabilities are at higher risk of food insecurity, making SNAP a critical support for this vulnerable population as well.
This USDA rulemaking is yet another attempt for the Administration to side step Congress and make cuts to SNAP benefits.  Congress reviewed SNAP policy during the 2018 Farm Bill, including the fact that states have options that may produce differences in SNAP eligibility benefit amounts from state to state.  Although the President's FY 2019 Budget included a request for a change similar to the proposed rule. Congress did not include such a change in the 2018 Farm Bill.  Indeed, evening out benefit amounts across states by lowering benefits for large numbers of participants does not promote SNAP's statutory purpose, but instead undermines its statutory purpose.
I strongly oppose the proposed rule that would cut food benefits for struggling people and undermine health in our community and across our nation.

3SquaresVT (our state's name for SNAP) is Vermont's first line of defense against hunger. It helps Vermonters afford enough food for themselves and their families, pulls people out of poverty, helps people learn and find and keep jobs, and improves health, both in the short term and in the long term. I moved to Vermont to attend graduate school. As a single mother and graduate student, I was able to work only 12-15 hours per week, and was paid a non-livable wage for that time. Without the 3SquaresVT program., I do not know how I would have made it through school. Once I graduated, I was unable to find a job for over a year. Again, 3SquaresVT helped my family make it through this difficult time. I would like to emphasize that I am not an exception. I know more single mothers than I care to count, who are (amazingly) juggling school, work, and raising children.

According to estimates from Vermont's Department for Children and Families (the agency that administers 3SquaresVT), this rule would mean that 26,000 Vermont households would receive a cut in their 3SquaresVT benefits, on average losing $82 per month for food; that's over 3 in 5 3SquaresVT households.

Additionally, with nearly $26 million fewer dollars per year coming into our state to help people in need buy more and better food, our local retailers and state economy would be harmed. This is unacceptable in my community. The struggles I share with my fellow single mothers highlight a lack of jobs that pay a livable wage as well as the need for a societal safety net that not only ensures our most vulnerable citizens get what they need, but that also supports people through the unexpected life changes many of us experience. Without the bare minimum support of comprehensive food assistance for those in need, the message we receive is that our lives do not count as much as people who are not in need of support. And that somehow this is our fault and should be treated punitively, rather than addressing the systemic ills that reinforce poverty and heighten the wealth gap (i.e. minimum wage, child care, education costs).

In a rural and cold-weather state like Vermont, people who struggle to make ends meet have a lot of obstacles to overcome. Especially at this time of year, it is cruel and misguided to attempt to weaken a program that is proven to help people buy more and better food.

They make a huge difference in the lives of low-income Vermonters and the health of our state as a whole, and should remain strong and accessible.

Dear SNAP Certification Policy Branch:

On behalf of the Dominican Sisters of Sinsinawa, WI  I appreciate the opportunity to comment on USDA's Notice of Proposed Rule regarding Supplemental Assistance Nutrition Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances. According to the Department's own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years. The goal of SNAP is to prevent people from going hungry. These changes would go against the stated goal of the program. 

We are a congregation of Catholic Sisters whose mission is to promote justice in all areas of society and our church. For over 170 years we have been faithful to that mission through our ministries in education and social service. The foundation of Catholic Social Teachings is the complete acceptance in the dignity of the human person. We believe every person deserves to be treated with dignity, which includes that every person, not matter status in our country, requires that he/she be given the necessities of life...food, clothing, and shelter.  

We have been ministering with people who are poor and vulnerable. We have ministered at food shelters and soup kitchens. We have seen the effects on children in schools who do not have enough to eat. We know the pressure parents experience trying to figure out how to feed their family for the month. SNAP has alleviated some of that pressure. However, these changes will up the pressure on families as they will have to choose between paying for housing and paying for food. 

According to Feeding Wisconsin the Wisconsin Assembly District 49 in which our motherhouse is located the percentage of food insecurity is 10%, the poverty rate is 5% and the unemployment rate is 14%. The changes will affect the people in our area.

According to one report, the Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue defended the changes by saying that it would help the American taxpayer. His defense is unconscionable! Is it acceptable in this country to cause people to go hungry in order to help those who have money? Our values and beliefs say NO! 

Part of the purpose of the change is to encourage people to work, however those in danger of losing access to SNAP might be discouraged from working because the new calculation would put them in a higher income bracket, causing them to lose access. 

SNAP lifted 3.2 million Americans out of poverty in 2018, according to the Census Bureau's Supplemental Poverty Measure. SNAP is nearly as effective as the Earned Income Tax Credit in lifting families above the poverty line, and far more effective than any other program in lifting families out of deep poverty. 

USDA should be strengthening the positive impacts of SNAP for health, well-being and economic activity, not making cuts to SNAP benefits.  [I/We] strongly oppose the proposed rule and request the USDA withdraw the rule and work with states to improve their SUA's under existing flexibility.

Dear SNAP Program Design Branch:
 
On behalf of the Brattleboro Food Co-op we appreciate the opportunity to comment on USDAs Notice of Proposed Rule regarding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances. According to the Departments own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years.

The proposed changes would exacerbate the struggles many low-income people already face in paying for both heat and utilities. This harm would be felt acutely in Vermont, where heating costs are especially high. It would cause serious harm to Vermonters, our community and the nation. The proposed rule is flaws and should be withdrawn.

SNAP (known in Vermont as 3SquaresVT) plays a critical role in addressing hunger and food insecurity in Vermont. For over 40 years, SNAP has been our nations first line of defense against hunger, because it works. It provides, on average, over 70,000 Vermonters and 40 million Americans with money to spend on food in grocery stores and farmers markets each month. It is proven to reduce hunger, lift people out of poverty, and leads to positive short and long-term health, education, and employment outcomes. 
 
3SVT allows people of lower income to shop for higher quality foods and prepare meals that support a healthy lifestyle. 
Policymakers recognize that household resources needed to pay for basics such as shelter, utility costs and childcare are not available to purchase food. That is why under current law, SNAP takes into account the utility expenses of each SNAP household. States adjust household benefits based on a state-specific Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) calculated by the state and approved by USDA. The current policy allows variances in SUAs to accommodate for differences in utility costs and rates, and allows states flexibility in how they calculate those costs. This is especially important in a state like Vermont, where heating costs are much higher than in other parts of the country.
The proposed rule would standardize and cap SUA calculations across the country based on survey data, but does not contain an adequate explanation of USDAs rationale for the methodology or reasoning behind this strategy or its accuracy. One thing is clear: the proposed rule would cause 19 percent of SNAP households to get lower SNAP monthly benefits, would disproportionately impact elderly people and people with disabilities, and would cause a national net cut to SNAP benefits amounting to $4.5 billion over five years. 
In Vermont, the impact of this proposal would be even more devastating, and only serve to increase hunger in our state and worsen the benefits cliff for thousands of Vermont families working to put enough food on the table for themselves and their families. According to estimates from Vermonts Department for Children and Families, this proposal would cause 68 percent of Vermont households to lose an average of $82 per month in benefits. This equates to over 26,000 Vermont households, and would mean a loss of over $25 million per year to Vermonts food economy. Additionally, 80 percent of 3SquaresVT households with an older adult or Vermonter with a disability would see a cut in their benefits. This is unacceptable in my community.
USDA should be strengthening the positive impacts of SNAP for health, well-being and economic activity, not making cuts to SNAP benefits.  We strongly oppose the proposed rule and request the USDA withdraw the rule and work with states to improve their SUAs under existing flexibility.

The real issue is that millions of Americans and thousands of Vermonters are struggling to make ends meet and arent able to access enough food to grow, learn, and stay healthy. Instead of proposing severe cuts to programs like SNAP, the Trump administration should be working to increase wages and improve access to housing, health care, and food assistance.

We strongly oppose the proposed rule that would cut food benefits for struggling people and harm our community. Instead, we request that USDA withdraw this rule and work with states to improve their SUAs under existing flexibility.

Dear SNAP Certification Policy Branch:

I appreciate the opportunity to comment on USDAs Notice of Proposed Rule regarding Supplemental Assistance Nutrition Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances. According to the Departments own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years.

Generalizing can lead to assumptions, and sometimes assumptions can hurt people.  I live in the city of Tacoma just south of Seattle in the state of Washington and I know what it's like to be hurt by assumptions.  Life was a lot different for me just a few years ago and by different, I mean there wasn't much light or hope.  As I hit that ""rock bottom"" point in my life, which is defined differently for everyone, I began humbling myself and asking for help because I knew I couldn't change my life on my own.  I connected with people with similar experiences, but who were living a life that was much brighter and full of hope.  I am forever grateful to the case workers, mentors, and volunteers who directed me towards helpful resources including SNAP.  SNAP helped me tremendously and to be honest, I probably would've ended up on the streets if it wasn't for SNAP.  Years later, I write to you now as a contributing member of my community and as an advocate for food justice and anti-poverty.

What the administration fails to continuously do is center the Americans these proposed changes will affect.  It is another way for the current administration to impose a ""pick yourself up by your boot straps"" change that again, assumes everyone starts at the same place in life.

Because of SNAP, and the ability for states to decide on who and how benefits are distributed, the program can ""promote the general welfare, to safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation's population by raising levels of nutrition among low-income households. Congress finds that the limited food purchasing power of low-income households contributes to hunger and malnutrition among members of such households. congress further finds that increased utilization of food in establishing and maintaining adequate national levels of nutrition will promote the distribution in a beneficial manner of the Nation's agricultural abundance and will strengthen the Nation's agricultural economy, as well as result in more orderly marketing and distribution of foods. To alleviate such hunger and malnutrition, a supplemental nutrition assistance program is herein authorized which will permit low-income households to obtain a more nutritious diet through normal channels of trade by increasing food purchasing power for all eligible households who apply for participation.

This USDA rulemaking is yet another attempt for the Administration to side step Congress and make cuts to SNAP benefits.  Congress reviewed SNAP policy during the 2018 Farm Bill, including the fact that states have options that may produce differences in SNAP eligibility benefit amounts from state to state.  Although the Presidents FY 2019 Budget included a request for a change similar to the proposed rule [https://www.obpa.usda.gov/32fns2019notes.pdf], Congress did not include such a change in the 2018 Farm Bill.  Indeed, evening out benefit amounts across states by lowering benefits for large numbers of participants does not promote SNAPs statutory purpose, but instead undermines its statutory purpose.

USDA should be strengthening the positive impacts of SNAP for health, well-being and economic activity, not making cuts to SNAP benefits.  I strongly oppose the proposed rule and request the USDA withdraw the rule and work with states to improve their SUA's under existing flexibility.

Sincerely,

Re:  Notice of Proposed Rule Making Regarding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances -- RIN 0584-AE69

Dear SNAP Certification Policy Branch:

I appreciate the opportunity to comment on USDAs Notice of Proposed Rule regarding Supplemental Assistance Nutrition Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances.  According to the Departments own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years.

The proposed rule would exacerbate the struggles many low-income people have paying for costs of both food and utilities.  It would have harmful impacts on health and well-being as well as on the economy. The proposed rule is flawed and should be withdrawn.
 
I work at a inner city hospital in St. Paul, Minnesota.  We serve primarily government payers and 8-9% of our patients admit to be food insecure.  

SNAPs statutory purpose, as declared by Congress, is to promote the general welfare, to safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation's population by raising levels of nutrition among low-income households. Congress finds that the limited food purchasing power of low-income households contributes to hunger and malnutrition among members of such households. Congress further finds that increased utilization of food in establishing and maintaining adequate national levels of nutrition will promote the distribution in a beneficial manner of the Nation's agricultural abundance and will strengthen the Nation's agricultural economy, as well as result in more orderly marketing and distribution of foods. To alleviate such hunger and malnutrition, a supplemental nutrition assistance program is herein authorized which will permit low-income households to obtain a more nutritious diet through normal channels of trade by increasing food purchasing power for all eligible households who apply for participation. 

SNAP plays a critical role in addressing hunger and food insecurity in our community. It is the first line of defense against hunger for low-income residents.


SNAP benefits respond quickly and effectively to changes in need, whether due to economic downturns or natural disasters. According to recent studies, it is estimated that $1 of SNAP benefits leads to between $1.50 and $1.80 in total economic activity during a recession. [See The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Economy:  New Estimates of the SNAP Multiplier, USDA Economic Research Service, July 2019, available at https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/93529/err-265.pdf?v=8010.7 pages 6-8 and Table 1 (regarding research by Blinder and Zandi)]
Policymakers recognize that household resources needed to pay for basics such as shelter, utility costs and childcare are not available to purchase food.  Under current law, SNAP takes into account the utility expenses of each SNAP household.  States adjust household benefits based on a state-specific Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) calculated by the state and approved by USDA. The current policy allows variances in SUAs to accommodate for differences in utility costs and rates, and allows states flexibility in how they calculate those costs. 

The proposed rule would standardize and cap SUA calculations across the country based on survey data. The proposed rule does not adequately explain USDAs rationale for capping the largest of the SUA components by calibrating to utility expense survey data for those no higher than the 80th percentile of low-income people and then capping other SUA components as well.   The proposed rule merely asserts that it calculated calibrating to the 50th percentile compared to the 80th percentile.  The proposed rule does not adequately explain whether USDA analyzed impacts calibrated to the 85th or higher percentiles and what the results of those estimates were.   The lack of such explanation is particularly concerning given research documented that 21 states had SUAs exceeding the 85th percentile estimates, possibly because in their efforts to mitigate benefit loss for households with very high utility costs. 

The Administration concedes that the proposed rule would cause 19 percent of SNAP households to get lower SNAP monthly benefits, would disproportionately impact elderly people and people with disabilities."

Dear SNAP Certification Policy Branch:

On behalf Ohio Association of Foodbanks, I appreciate the opportunity to comment on USDA's Notice of Proposed Rule regarding Supplemental Assistance Nutrition Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances. According to the Department's own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years.

The proposed rule would further exacerbate the struggles many low-income people have paying for costs of both food and utilities.  In Ohio, we estimate that 40% of all SNAP households with children would lose benefits under this proposed SUA rule. A recent study of Ohioans using food pantries in Ohio, found that 70% of respondents reported they had to choose between food and utilities. Meaning 7 in 10 households are already facing a heat or eat crisis. It is further estimated that this propose rule, if it went into effect would directly impact over 300,000 SNAP households who would see their SNAP benefits reduced by an average of $40.00 per month. This proposed rule will increase hunger for Ohioans already struggling to put food on their tables and will have harmful impacts on their health and well-being as well as on the economy. The proposed rule is flawed and should be withdrawn.

The Ohio Association of Foodbanks is Ohio's largest charitable response to hunger.  Our network is made up of 12 Feeding America foodbanks and 3,601-member food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters, and supplemental feeding programs, serving all of Ohio's 88 counties. Together, our network distributed 229,546,132 pounds of food, or about 191.3 million meals, serving Ohio families 3,438,315 times in 2019. Some of these households came to a food pantry just once for help in an emergency. Others came a handful of times when paychecks came up short. Still others rely on our network regularly for help because their limited fixed incomes and SNAP/food stamp benefits aren't enough to meet their basic needs for food. We strive to be there when our hungry friends and neighbors need us.

SNAP is the first line of defense against hunger in our state and nation, not foodbanks. SNAP provides 12 meals to every 1 meal my network provides. 

The impact of this proposed rule would be devastating to Ohio. Ohio would lose over $150 million per year in SNAP benefits, resulting in a nearly $250 million loss in annual economic activity.

o	Nearly 1.7 million Ohioans (14.5% of the population) are food insecure and 83% live below the Federal poverty line. The average SNAP household lives on just $829 per month, with SNAP providing an additional $126 per month in nutrition assistance. FNS does not appear to consider how the proposed rule would negatively impact the fundamental goal of the Food and Nutrition Act to ""provide for improved levels of nutrition among low-income households."" 

o	71% of SNAP households in Ohio have documented shelter expenses, averaging $778 per month. Even so, the average shelter deduction in Ohio is just $429 due to the federal cap on shelter deductions for most households. Those most likely to see their SNAP benefits cut because of this proposal are households with elderly and/or disabled members, since their shelter deduction is not artificially capped. 

The proposed rule would hurt Ohio's economy, especially retail grocery stores and the jobs they provide in our communities.
o	SNAP is an important source of food purchasing power for struggling families and often keeps critical grocery stores in low-income neighborhoods afloat. If Ohio saw this purchasing power reduced by $150 million per year, Ohio's most vulnerable communities would likely endure widespread grocery store closures, lost jobs, and new food deserts.

This USDA rulemaking is yet another attempt for the Administration to circumvent the will of Congress and make cuts to SNAP benefits.  Congress reviewed SNAP policy during the 2018 Farm Bill, including the fact that states have options that may produce differences in SNAP eligibility benefit amounts from state to state.  

USDA should be strengthening the positive impacts of SNAP for health, well-being and economic activity, not making cuts to SNAP benefits. The Ohio Association of Foodbanks, our 12 member foodbanks and 3,601 member charities strongly oppose the proposed rule and request the USDA withdraw the rule and work with states to improve their SUA's under existing flexibility.

Lisa Hamler-Fugitt

It helps Vermonters afford enough food for themselves and their families, pulls people out of poverty, helps people learn and find and keep jobs, and improves health, both in the short term and in the long term. My work is in community outreach in a region of Vermont that has a high food insecurity rate. I love my community and want to see it thrive. It simply cannot if my neighbors and friends are locked in a poverty cycle without nourishing food. Food is a right, not a benefit.

According to estimates from Vermonts Department for Children and Families (the agency that administers 3SquaresVT), this rule would mean that 26,000 Vermont households would receive a cut in their 3SquaresVT benefits, on average losing $82 per month for food; thats over 3 in 5 3SquaresVT households. It would harm older Vermonters and people with disabilities at an even higher rate; 80 percent of these households would receive a cut. Additionally, with nearly $26 million fewer dollars per year coming into our state to help people in need buy more and better food, our local retailers and state economy would be harmed. This is unacceptable in my community. Our local food shelves and meal sites are no longer emergency services, but essential to keeping Vermonters fed. I dont know that this services would be enough if this proposal was to pass. It is the responsibility of our government to ensure everyone has access to enough food every day.

According to the Departments own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years.

The proposed rule would exacerbate the struggles many low-income people have paying for costs of both food and utilities. This will harm the rural poor, the urban poor, and families across the US.  It would have harmful impacts on health and well-being as well as on the economy. The proposed rule is flawed and should be withdrawn.

I work with the rural poor in southern Delaware and many families depend on these resources to survive. In particular, this is important when heating and cooling demands are high. I have had patients stop medication to afford air conditioning or cut their heat to afford medication. This is unacceptable to put lives at risk to cut your budget. These benefits need to be expanded for these families.

I am a student at the University of Vermont, and I have seen the effects of 3SquaresVT firsthand. I am the President of a club that cooks breakfast on Saturday mornings at the local food pantry for homeless and low-income residents in the Burlington community. This is my second year acting as President; I plan the meals we serve each week. I find myself constantly having to adjust the amount of food I purchase based on the time of the month. Fewer people come at the start of the month because they have food stamps again. The number of people who come each week generally doubles from the first weekend of the month to the last. Additionally, many people who come prefer to take their meals to go in order to space it out throughout the day. They stretch one meal into three because they cannot afford to eat anything else.People in Vermont are suffering already; these changes would make many suffer even more. I believe that food security is a fundamental right that should not be taken away. Additionally, Vermont is infamous for its harsh winters; this new rule change would force many to choose between heating their homes and putting food on their tables. This is unacceptable and I do strongly oppose the implementation of this rule as it currently stands.

Dear SNAP Certification Policy Branch:

Feeding Texas appreciates the opportunity to comment on the USDAs Notice of Proposed Rule Making regarding Supplemental Assistance Nutrition Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances. According to the Departments own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years.  Its negative impacts would include harming health outcomes, disproportionately affecting families with children, and undermining SNAPs effectiveness as an economic stimulus. The proposed rule is flawed and should be withdrawn.
 
Feeding Texas is a statewide organization dedicated to leading a unified effort for a hunger-free Texas. We move millions of hungry Texans toward food security through a statewide network of 21 food banks; strengthen the collective response to hunger through collaboration and scaling success; and lead the public conversation needed to solve hunger in Texas. Feeding Texas remains committed to protecting and strengthening SNAP, as it plays a critical role in addressing hunger and food insecurity in our state. At Feeding Texas, we believe that every Texan should have the chance to be healthy and financially secure.

Hunger and food insecurity are serious problems in our nation and state. Despite record low unemployment rates, Texas continues to be one of the hungriest states in America and SNAP is the first line of defense for 3.3 million low-income Texans who rely on it to help feed their families. 

According to recent data for 2018 from the Economic Research Service, 14.0 percent of Texas households were food insecure; well above the national average of 11.7 percent for the same time period.   That means 1.5 million households in Texas worried about how they were going to put food on the table at some point during the year. Texas is tied with California for the largest population of food insecure households in the country, and SNAP is vital to their health and financial well-being.   

Hunger disproportionally impacts Texans of color and low-income households.  Nationally food insecurity rates were 5.0 percentage points higher for Hispanics than the general population, and 10 percentage points higher for Blacks.   For low-income households, those below 185 percent of poverty, a staggering 29.1 percent were food insecure in 2018.   While food insecurity data by race and income for Texas are not available, per capita incomes are much lower for Black ($23,471) and Hispanic ($18,228) Texans, which leads to increased food insecurity and increases the importance of SNAP to family food budgets. 

By allowing households to purchase a more adequate diet, SNAP not only fights hunger but research has found that receipt of SNAP in early childhood improved high school graduation rates, adult earnings, and adult health.   SNAP lifted 3.6 million Americans out of poverty in 2016, according to the Census Bureaus Supplemental Poverty Measure. SNAP is nearly as effective as the Earned Income Tax Credit in lifting families above the poverty line, and far more effective than any other program in lifting families out of deep poverty.  

SNAP benefits provide our nations first line of defense against hunger and food insecurity.  The program considers households expenditures for certain non-food basics, such as shelter, utility costs, and childcare, in recognition that those spent resources are not available to pay for food.

Under current law, SNAP considers the utility expenses of each SNAP household.  States adjust household benefits based on a state-specific Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) calculated by the state and approved by USDA. The current policy allows variances in SUAs to accommodate for differences in utility costs and rates and allows states flexibility in how they calculate those costs.

Dear SNAP Certification Policy Branch:
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on USDAs Notice of Proposed Rule regarding Supplemental Assistance Nutrition Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances on behalf of the Critical Issues Forum: Advocacy for Social Justice (CIF). CIF was formed by a group of synagogues located in Montgomery County, Maryland. It is comprised of Temple Beth Ami, Kol Shalom, and Adat Shalom, and represents over 1750 households and three denominations of Judaism: reform, conservative, and reconstructionist.
We oppose the proposed changes as it will exacerbate the struggles many low-income people have paying for costs of both food and utilities. It would have harmful impacts on health and well-being as well as on the economy. The proposed rule is flawed and should be withdrawn.
According to the Departments own estimates, the proposed rule is expected to reduce SNAP benefit payments by about $1 billion per year in net. While some States will have an increase in benefits, 29 States are expected to see a net loss of SNAP benefits (about $1.54 billion annually). While we of course support increasing SNAP benefits, we can not accept a decrease of benefits given the impacts on such vulnerable households.
SNAPs statutory purpose, as declared by Congress, is
to promote the general welfare, to safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation's population by raising levels of nutrition among low-income households."

Dear SNAP Certification Policy Branch:

The San Antonio Food Bank (SAFB) appreciates the opportunity to comment on the USDAs Notice of Proposed Rule Making regarding Supplemental Assistance Nutrition Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances. 

According to the Departments own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years.  Its negative impacts would include harming health outcomes, disproportionately affecting families with children, and undermining SNAPs effectiveness as an economic stimulus. Please consider - the proposed rule is flawed and should be withdrawn.   
 
As part of Feeding Texas (statewide organization); we are certainly dedicated to a unified effort for a hunger-free Texas. Together with our sister Food Banks in the state - we move millions of hungry Texans toward food security through a statewide network of 21 food banks.  Together - we strive to strengthen the collective response to hunger through collaboration and scaling success; and lead the public conversation needed to solve hunger in Texas by shaping public policy and creating advocacy re the issue of hunger.  In SW Texas - 1 in 5 adults and 1 in 4 kids are experiencing hunger.  

Feeding America (national organization) and Feeding Texas both remain committed to protecting and strengthening SNAP, as it plays a critical role in addressing hunger and food insecurity in our country and state. As a statewide collective effort to feed hungry Texans and specifically in Southwest Texas, we certainly believe that every food insecure family and individual should have a chance to be healthy and financially secure.

Re:  Notice of Proposed Rule Making Regarding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances -- RIN 0584-AE69
 
Dear SNAP Program Design Branch:
 
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on USDAs Notice of Proposed Rule regarding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances. According to the Departments own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years. I want to voice my strong opposition to this proposal; if it goes into effect, this will cause serious harm to Vermonters in my community, as well as people across the country. The proposed rule should be withdrawn.

3SquaresVT (our states name for SNAP) is Vermonts first line of defense against hunger. It helps Vermonters afford enough food for themselves and their families, pulls people out of poverty, helps people learn and find and keep jobs, and improves health, both in the short term and in the long term. 3SquaresVT is the make or break lifeline for many of my clients. This is the tipping point for keeping them living independently at home. Most of my clients are hesitant to even sign up for a benefit because they do not want to take away from others, even though they are struggling financially to keep food on their table for themselves. 

According to estimates from Vermonts Department for Children and Families (the agency that administers 3SquaresVT), this rule would mean that 26,000 Vermont households would receive a cut in their 3SquaresVT benefits, on average losing $82 per month for food; thats over 3 in 5 3SquaresVT households. It would harm older Vermonters and people with disabilities at an even higher rate; 80 percent of these households would receive a cut. Additionally, with nearly $26 million fewer dollars per year coming into our state to help people in need buy more and better food, our local retailers and state economy would be harmed. This is unacceptable in my community. They would have less food which would be detrimental to their over-all well-being. If there is a cut to the benefit many of my clients would have to make a choice between food or other necessary resources like, fuel, electricity, medications etc. The food benefit is their lifeline. 

In a rural and cold-weather state like Vermont, people who struggle to make ends meet have a lot of obstacles to overcome. Especially at this time of year, it is cruel and misguided to attempt to weaken a program that is proven to help people buy more and better food. Please dont make accessing food even harder for the thousands of Vermonters and millions of Americans working hard to stay healthy while covering their bills and keeping the heat on. Instead of proposing to cut 3SquaresVT, I urge you to work to increase wages and improve access to housing, healthcare, and food assistance programs like 3SquaresVT. They make a huge difference in the lives of low-income Vermonters and the health of our state as a whole, and should remain strong and accessible.

Sincerely,

Kim Champine

Re:  Notice of Proposed Rule Making Regarding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances -- RIN 0584-AE69
 
Dear SNAP Program Design Branch:
 
On behalf of RiseVT of Bennington County I appreciate the opportunity to comment on USDAs Notice of Proposed Rule regarding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances. According to the Departments own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years.

The proposed changes would exacerbate the struggles many low-income people already face in paying for both heat and utilities. This harm would be felt acutely in Vermont, where heating costs are especially high. It would cause serious harm to Vermonters, especially those who are already food insecure such as children, low-income families and elders, our community and the nation. The proposed rule is flaws and should be withdrawn.

As Program Manager for RiseVT in Bennington County it is my responsibility to ensure healthy options for ALL Vermonters, which includes affordability and accessibility to healthy, nutritious foods. By putting the 3SquaresVT benefits in jeopardy you are, in turn, putting the health of the most vulnerable in jeopardy. This is not acceptable. 
 
SNAP (known in Vermont as 3SquaresVT) plays a critical role in addressing hunger and food insecurity in Vermont. For over 40 years, SNAP has been our nations first line of defense against hunger, because it works. It provides, on average, over 70,000 Vermonters and 40 million Americans with money to spend on food in grocery stores and farmers markets each month. It is proven to reduce hunger, lift people out of poverty, and leads to positive short and long-term health, education, and employment outcomes. 
Policymakers recognize that household resources needed to pay for basics such as shelter, utility costs and childcare are not available to purchase food. That is why under current law, SNAP takes into account the utility expenses of each SNAP household. States adjust household benefits based on a state-specific Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) calculated by the state and approved by USDA. The current policy allows variances in SUAs to accommodate for differences in utility costs and rates, and allows states flexibility in how they calculate those costs. This is especially important in a state like Vermont, where heating costs are much higher than in other parts of the country.
The proposed rule would standardize and cap SUA calculations across the country based on survey data, but does not contain an adequate explanation of USDAs rationale for the methodology or reasoning behind this strategy or its accuracy. One thing is clear: the proposed rule would cause 19 percent of SNAP households to get lower SNAP monthly benefits, would disproportionately impact elderly people and people with disabilities, and would cause a national net cut to SNAP benefits amounting to $4.5 billion over five years. 
In Vermont, the impact of this proposal would be even more devastating, and only serve to increase hunger in our state and worsen the benefits cliff for thousands of Vermont families working to put enough food on the table for themselves and their families. According to estimates from Vermonts Department for Children and Families, this proposal would cause 68 percent of Vermont households to lose an average of $82 per month in benefits. This equates to over 26,000 Vermont households, and would mean a loss of over $25 million per year to Vermonts food economy. Additionally, 80 percent of 3SquaresVT households with an older adult or Vermonter with a disability would see a cut in their benefits. This is unacceptable in my community.
This USDA rulemaking is yet another attempt for the Administration to side step Congress and make cuts to SNAP benefits. Congress reviewed SNAP policy during the 2018 Farm Bill, including the fact that states have options that may produce differences in SNAP eligibility benefit amounts from state to state. Although the Presidents FY 2019 Budget included a request for a change similar to the proposed rule [https://www.obpa.usda.gov/32fns2019notes.pdf], Congress did not include such a change in the 2018 Farm Bill. Indeed, evening out benefit amounts across states by lowering benefits for large numbers of participants does not promote SNAPs statutory purpose, but rather directly undermines and seeks to weaken it.
USDA should be strengthening the positive impacts of SNAP for health, well-being and economic activity, not making cuts to SNAP benefits. I strongly oppose the proposed rule and request the USDA withdraw the rule and work with states to improve their SUAs u"

To alleviate such hunger and malnutrition, a supplemental nutrition assistance program is herein authorized which will permit low-income households to obtain a more nutritious diet through normal channels of trade by increasing food purchasing power for all eligible households who apply for participation."" 

SNAP plays a critical role in addressing hunger and food insecurity in our community. It is the first line of defense against hunger for low-income residents.

SNAP benefits respond quickly and effectively to changes in need, whether due to economic downturns or natural disasters. According to recent studies, it is estimated that $1 of SNAP benefits leads to between $1.50 and $1.80 in total economic activity during a recession.

Dear SNAP Certification Policy Branch:

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on USDA's Notice of Proposed Rule regarding Supplemental Assistance Nutrition Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances. According to the Department's analysis, the proposed rule threatens to cut SNAP benefits for 19% of our nation's SNAP caseload, amounting to a $4.5 billion reduction in SNAP benefits over the next 5 years. SNAP is the first line of defense against hunger, helping low income people afford basic nutrition to keep themselves and their families healthy for school and for work. As someone who thinks that it is immoral to let our neighbors go hungry, I urge you to withdraw this deeply flawed and harmful rule.

The proposed rule would standardize and cap SUA calculations across the country based on survey data. The proposed rule does not adequately explain USDA's rationale for capping the largest of the SUA components by calibrating to utility expense survey data for those no higher than the 80th percentile of low-income people and then capping other SUA components as well.   The proposed rule merely asserts that it calculated calibrating to the 50th percentile compared to the 80th percentile.  The proposed rule does not adequately explain whether USDA analyzed impacts calibrated to the 85th or higher percentiles and what the results of those estimates were.   The lack of such explanation is particularly concerning given research documented that 21 states had SUAs exceeding the 85th percentile estimates, possibly because in their efforts to mitigate benefit loss for households with very high utility costs. 

The Administration concedes that the proposed rule would cause 19 percent of SNAP households to get lower SNAP monthly benefits, would disproportionately impact elderly people and people with disabilities, and would cause a national net cut to SNAP benefits amounting to $4.5 billion over five years.

Here in Washington State, the impact of the proposed rule would be dramatically worse: according to our state's Department of Social and Health Services, more than 75% of our state's SNAP households could see an average reduction of $47 in monthly benefits. That equates to a 20% reduction in monthly benefits or nearly a week's worth of food for struggling households. Over 350,000 Washington households would see a reduction in their benefits, and that translates to taking food off their tables and exacerbating their struggles with hunger and affording other basic necessities for housing, health care, childcare and transportation.

The loss of food assistance for these families also translates to a loss of revenue to our local economies. SNAP benefits are dollars spent on buying food from grocery stores, farmers markets, and other food retailers. That puts money in those businesses pockets and generates jobs while putting food on the tables of struggling families. Every cut proposed to SNAP spending only hurts all of us as it means fewer benefits spent in communities which hurts businesses and reduces work hours or available jobs.

Nothing in your analysis suggests a need for this proposal or its projected impact of reducing food assistance that is already woefully inadequate to support a household's basic nutritional needs. Instead, this is the third proposal this year that threatens SNAP eligibility and benefits for struggling people suggesting that the only interest at play here is pure animus against low income people. Withdraw this rule and your other rule proposals that cut SNAP for eligible households.

Thank you.

Re:  Notice of Proposed Rule Making Regarding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances - RIN 0584-AE69 

Dear SNAP Certification Policy Branch:

On behalf of First 5 Alameda County (First 5), I appreciate the opportunity to comment on USDAs Notice of Proposed Rule Making, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program: Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances, published in the federal register on October 3, 2019. 

We strongly oppose the changes proposed by USDA to alter the methodology for calculating standard utility allowances, because of the significant harm the change would inflict on Californias children. According to the Departments own estimates, the proposed rule would lower monthly SNAP benefits for 20 percent of households with children and cause a national net cut to SNAP benefits, amounting to $4.5 billion over five years. These proposed cuts would exacerbate hunger and have harmful and lasting impacts on the health, educational achievement, and well-being of Californias children. 

First 5 was created with the passage of Californias Proposition 10 in 1998 which emphasizes an integrated, comprehensive, and collaborative system for supporting, and improving the early development of children. For over twenty years, First 5 has worked to improve the lives of children and their families through effective, responsive, and community-driven programming, as well as advocating for policies that address persistent racial and economic inequities. By advancing programs and public policies that address structural inequality, we believe we can narrow disparities and give Alameda County children the best start in life. 

Therefore, we understand the importance of SNAP to children and their families. Our nations largest food security program is also one of our most effective anti-poverty measures, expanding household budgets and lifting nearly 5 million people nationwide and 800,000 Californians out of poverty in 2014.  More than 74% of California SNAP participants belong to families with children and over 100,000 Alameda County residents receive SNAP benefits. 
 
SNAP benefits persist well beyond childhood. Studies indicate that receipt of SNAP in early childhood leads to improved high school graduation rates, adult earnings, and adult health.  The proposed changes to Categorical Eligibility in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program 


will directly harm the long-term prospects of young children and their families.  Therefore, we believe the proposed rule is misguided and urge you to withdraw it.

SNAP Fights Child Food Insecurity and Child Poverty
Children need food to grow, to develop, and to be healthy, but two million California children live in low-income households that do not have access to enough food and 435 of children in our county are food insecure.  SNAP plays a critical role in improving access to food for children in our community and across the state. As the nations largest federal food assistance program, SNAP provides low-income households with monthly funds specifically designated for food, and benefited over 1.9 million California children in 2018 and close to 10,000 children Alameda County .  Beyond its role in fighting food insecurity, SNAP lifted 3.2 million Americans out of poverty in 2018, according to the Census Bureaus Supplemental Poverty Measure. Cuts to SNAP would have devastating effects for Californias children.  

The Proposed Rule Will Disproportionately Harm Households with Children
In its Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) of the proposed rule, USDA acknowledges standardizing and capping SUA calculations will result in 19% of SNAP households with children experiencing a SNAP benefit cut of $336 annually, on average. However, this estimate is based on data from 2014. Other organizations have estimated the potential impact to be much higher, with up to 68% of affected households being households with children.  Better and updated data is needed to fully reflect the potential harm of the SNAP benefit cut on households with children. In addition, the USDA analysis does not estimate the rippling effects of this proposed rule on children. SNAP is more effective than any other program in lifting families out of deep poverty and is known to improve high school graduation rates, adult earnings, and participants overall health.  A decision to cut SNAP benefits must analyze the impacts it will have on the health and well-being of our nations children. We strongly oppose the proposed rule and request the USDA withdraw the rule and work with states to improve their SUAs under existing flexibility.

Sincerely,
 
Kristin Spanos

Dear SNAP Certification Policy Branch:

On behalf of the Wisconsin Council of Churches, we appreciate the opportunity to comment on U.S.D.A.'s Notice of Proposed Rule regarding Supplemental Assistance Nutrition Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances. 

According to the Department's own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years. Many low-income people in Wisconsin already struggle to both put food on their family's table and pay for essential utilities to heat and cool their homes. This rule would make life harder for these people, harming their health and well-being. 

In addition, it would harm Wisconsin communities - most SNAP benefits are spent in local businesses and provide essential nutrition that helps workers to be productive and children to learn.  SNAP improves recipients' health, thus reducing health care costs that would otherwise be borne, one way or another, by the community. It responds rapidly to increased need due to economic downturns or unemployment, but also to improved economic conditions, thus helping to stabilize the financial situation of households and communities.

This deeply flawed rule, therefore, should be withdrawn.  

The Wisconsin Council of Churches (WCC) is a network of Christian churches and faith-based organizations committed to working together across our many differences. The Council connects 20 Christian traditions, which have within them approximately 2,000 congregations and over one million church members. Exercising holy imagination, we help one another make courageous choices that lead toward peacemaking, social and economic justice for Wisconsin's most vulnerable residents, the vitality of the church, and the well-being of our neighbors.  

Our members find common ground in their concern to alleviate hunger in their communities through direct service activities, such as food pantries and soup kitchens.  However, we recognize that such activities, though essential, are limited. Programs like SNAP are indispensable for ensuring that our neighbors with limited means can live healthy and productive lives, and care for themselves and their families.  These programs must be kept strong, effective, adequate, and available to all who need them. This proposed rule is a step in exactly the wrong direction.
 
SNAP is the first line of defense against hunger for low-income residents.  According to the U.S.D.A.'s own report on food security in the U.S. in 2018, nearly one in ten Wisconsin households lacked assured access to adequate, nutritious food at some time during the year.  The consequences experiencing food insecurity in childhood can last a lifetime.  

The proposed change to the Standard Utility Allowance lacks a coherent rationale.  The proposed rule would standardize and cap SUA calculations across the country based on survey data. The proposed rule does not adequately explain why the U.S.D.A. would cap the largest of the SUA components by calibrating to utility expense survey data for those no higher than the 80th percentile of low-income people and then capping other SUA components as well.   The proposed rule merely asserts that it calculated calibrating to the 50th percentile compared to the 80th percentile.  The proposed rule does not adequately explain whether U.S.D.A. analyzed impacts calibrated to the 85th or higher percentiles and what the results of those estimates were.   The lack of such explanation is particularly concerning given research documented that 21 states had SUAs exceeding the 85th percentile estimates, possibly because in their efforts to mitigate benefit loss for households with very high utility costs. 

The Administration concedes that the proposed rule would cause 19 percent of SNAP households to get lower SNAP monthly benefits, would disproportionately impact elderly people and people with disabilities, and would cause a national net cut to SNAP benefits amounting to $4.5 billion over five years.  

These harms to the most vulnerable members of our community are unacceptable. Instead of making cuts to SNAP benefits, U.S.D.A. should be strengthening the SNAP to increase its positive benefits for health, well-being and economic activity.  We strongly oppose the proposed rule and request the U.S.D.A. withdraw the rule and work with states to improve their SUA's under existing flexibility.

Dear SNAP Program Design Branch:

 

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on USDAs Notice of Proposed Rule regarding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances. According to the Departments own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years. I want to voice my strong opposition to this proposal; if it goes into effect, this will cause serious harm to Vermonters in my community, as well as people across the country. The proposed rule should be withdrawn.


3SquaresVT (our states name for SNAP) is Vermonts first line of defense against hunger. It helps Vermonters afford enough food for themselves and their families, pulls people out of poverty, helps people learn and find and keep jobs, and improves health, both in the short term and in the long term. I help our states older clients complete applications and maintain their benefits. This is often their ""make or break"" for being able to live on their own, have the lowest threshold of financial well being, and maintain some sort of healthy eating habit. 


According to estimates from Vermonts Department for Children and Families (the agency that administers 3SquaresVT), this rule would mean that 26,000 Vermont households would receive a cut in their 3SquaresVT benefits, on average losing $82 per month for food; thats over 3 in 5 3SquaresVT households. It would harm older Vermonters and people with disabilities at an even higher rate; 80 percent of these households would receive a cut. Additionally, with nearly $26 million fewer dollars per year coming into our state to help people in need buy more and better food, our local retailers and state economy would be harmed. This is unacceptable in my community. The benefits to our older community is imperative to their independent survival. Those receiving benefits rely on the funds to maintain their lives in their homes. Decreasing this  would drastically change their financial situation and thus directly effect their living situation, putting more older Vermonters at risk. 

In a rural and cold-weather state like Vermont, people who struggle to make ends meet have a lot of obstacles to overcome. Especially at this time of year, it is cruel and misguided to attempt to weaken a program that is proven to help people buy more and better food. Please dont make accessing food even harder for the thousands of Vermonters and millions of Americans working hard to stay healthy while covering their bills and keeping the heat on. Instead of proposing to cut 3SquaresVT, I urge you to work to increase wages and improve access to housing, healthcare, and food assistance programs like 3SquaresVT. They make a huge difference in the lives of low-income Vermonters and the health of our state as a whole, and should remain strong and accessible.

On behalf of [fill in organization if applicable] I/we appreciate the opportunity to comment on USDAs Notice of Proposed Rule regarding Supplemental Assistance Nutrition Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances. [Link] According to the Departments own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years.

The proposed rule would exacerbate the struggles many low-income people have paying for costs of both food and utilities.  It would have harmful impacts on health and well-being as well as on the economy. The proposed rule is flawed and should be withdrawn.

SNAPs statutory purpose, as declared by Congress, is to promote the general welfare, to safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation's population by raising levels of nutrition among low-income households. Congress finds that the limited food purchasing power of low-income households contributes to hunger and malnutrition among members of such households. Congress further finds that increased utilization of food in establishing and maintaining adequate national levels of nutrition will promote the distribution in a beneficial manner of the Nation's agricultural abundance and will strengthen the Nation's agricultural economy, as well as result in more orderly marketing and distribution of foods. To alleviate such hunger and malnutrition, a supplemental nutrition assistance program is herein authorized which will permit low-income households to obtain a more nutritious diet through normal channels of trade by increasing food purchasing power for all eligible households who apply for participation. 

Policymakers recognize that household resources needed to pay for basics such as shelter, utility costs and childcare are not available to purchase food.  Under current law, SNAP takes into account the utility expenses of each SNAP household.  States adjust household benefits based on a state-specific Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) calculated by the state and approved by USDA. The current policy allows variances in SUAs to accommodate for differences in utility costs and rates, and allows states flexibility in how they calculate those costs. 

The proposed rule would standardize and cap SUA calculations across the country based on survey data. The proposed rule does not adequately explain USDAs rationale for capping the largest of the SUA components by calibrating to utility expense survey data for those no higher than the 80th percentile of low-income people and then capping other SUA components as well.   The proposed rule merely asserts that it calculated calibrating to the 50th percentile compared to the 80th percentile.  The proposed rule does not adequately explain whether USDA analyzed impacts calibrated to the 85th or higher percentiles and what the results of those estimates were.   The lack of such explanation is particularly concerning given research documented that 21 states had SUAs exceeding the 85th percentile estimates, possibly because in their efforts to mitigate benefit loss for households with very high utility costs. 

The Administration concedes that the proposed rule would cause 19 percent of SNAP households to get lower SNAP monthly benefits, would disproportionately impact elderly people and people with disabilities, and would cause a national net cut to SNAP benefits amounting to $4.5 billion over five years.

This USDA rulemaking is yet another attempt for the Administration to side step Congress and make cuts to SNAP benefits.  Congress reviewed SNAP policy during the 2018 Farm Bill, including the fact that states have options that may produce differences in SNAP eligibility benefit amounts from state to state.  Although the Presidents FY 2019 Budget included a request for a change similar to the proposed rule [https://www.obpa.usda.gov/32fns2019notes.pdf], Congress did not include such a change in the 2018 Farm Bill.  Indeed, evening out benefit amounts across states by lowering benefits for large numbers of participants does not promote SNAPs statutory purpose, but instead undermines its statutory purpose.

USDA should be strengthening the positive impacts of SNAP for health, well-being and economic activity, not making cuts to SNAP benefits.  I strongly oppose the proposed rule and request the USDA withdraw the rule and work with states to improve their SUAs under existing flexibility.

Sincerely,

Dear SNAP Program Design Branch:
 
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on USDAs Notice of Proposed Rule regarding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances. According to the Departments own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years. I want to voice my strong opposition to this proposal; if it goes into effect, this will cause serious harm to Vermonters in my community, as well as people across the country. The proposed rule should be withdrawn.

3SquaresVT (our states name for SNAP) is Vermonts first line of defense against hunger. It helps Vermonters afford enough food for themselves and their families, pulls people out of poverty, helps people learn and find and keep jobs, and improves health, both in the short term and in the long term. Healthy kids improve the learning environment for all of our children, and cost less.

Vermont is very rural and has a long cold winter. Our young families and our seniors who need this benefit are helped to thrive with it. 

Please help to increase wages and improve access to housing, healthcare, and food assistance programs like 3SquaresVT. They make a huge difference in the lives of low-income Vermonters and the health of our state as a whole, and should remain strong and accessible.

Sincerely,

Having adequate food is what keeps us healthy and less likely to have high medical expenses.
Having adequate food is what helps children learn the best they can and be part of an educated community.
Having adequate food is what gives people energy to do their jobs, contribute to their communities, bolster the economy, and be better parents and caregivers.
Having adequate food is what helps people know that they belong and have dignity.
What does the proposed rule change say about how we as a nation treat our most vulnerable?
I volunteer to mentor women who are transitioning from incarceration back in to my community.  They face many hardships and barriers on their journey back to integration and independence.  Programs such as 3SquaresVT (our states name for SNAP) demonstrates to them that their community cares about their success.  The woman I mentor now has secured a full-time job and is working very diligently to find stability in her own life while she financially supports others, too.  She absolutely depends on 3SquaresVT to make it through her week.

Please do not weaken the 3SquaresVT benefits for my neighbors.

In a rural and cold-weather state like Vermont, people who struggle to make ends meet have a lot of obstacles to overcome. Especially at this time of year, it is cruel and misguided to attempt to weaken a program that is proven to help people buy more and better food. Please dont make accessing food even harder for the thousands of Vermonters and millions of Americans working hard to stay healthy while covering their bills and keeping the heat on. Instead of proposing to cut 3SquaresVT, I urge you to work to increase wages and improve access to housing, healthcare, and food assistance programs like 3SquaresVT. They make a huge difference in the lives of low-income Vermonters and the health of our state as a whole, and should remain strong and accessible.

According to the Departments own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years. I want to voice my strong opposition to this proposal; if it goes into effect, this will cause serious harm to Vermonters in my community, as well as people across the country.

3SquaresVT (our states name for SNAP) is Vermonts first line of defense against hunger. It helps Vermonters afford enough food for themselves and their families, pulls people out of poverty, helps people learn and find and keep jobs, and improves health, both in the short term and in the long term.

The proposed changes would exacerbate the struggles many low-income people already face in paying for both heat and utilities. This harm would be felt acutely in Vermont, where heating costs are especially high. In this state, and in Bennington County, we know that household resources needed to pay for basics such as shelter, utility costs and childcare are not available to purchase food. The Standard Utility Allowance (SUA), currently calculated by states and approved by the USDA, allows states flexibility in calculating the costs of utility costs and rates. Under current law, SNAP considers the utility expenses of each SNAP household. This SUA flexibility is crucial in a state like Vermont, where heating costs are much higher than in other parts of the country.
The proposed rule would standardize and cap SUA calculations across the country based on survey data but does not contain an adequate explanation of USDAs rationale for the methodology or reasoning behind this strategy or its accuracy. One thing is clear: the proposed rule would cause 19 percent of SNAP households to get lower SNAP monthly benefits, would disproportionately impact elderly people and people with disabilities, and would cause a national net cut to SNAP benefits amounting to $4.5 billion over five years. 



According to estimates from Vermonts Department for Children and Families (the agency that administers 3SquaresVT), this rule would mean that 26,000 Vermont households would receive a cut in their 3SquaresVT benefits, on average losing $82 per month for food; thats over 3 in 5 3SquaresVT households. With 17% of children in Bennington County living below the poverty line that rely on monthly SNAP benefits (greater than the overall rate of 13% in Vermont), families with young children in the county will feel this change acutely. It would harm older Vermonters and people with disabilities at an even higher rate; 80 percent of these households would receive a cut. The American Community Survey indicates that 22% of the population of Bennington County, VT is 65 or older, and that number continues to climb as the median age in Bennington increases. These cuts would be devastating to the health and welfare of our senior citizens.  Additionally, with nearly $26 million fewer dollars per year coming into our state to help people in need buy more and better food, our local retailers and state economy would be harmed. This is unacceptable in my community and my state. 

In a rural and cold-weather state like Vermont, people who struggle to make ends meet have a lot of obstacles to overcome. It is harmful and misguided to attempt to weaken a program that is proven to help people buy more and better food, especially at this time of year that presents additional challenges to individuals and families. Please dont make accessing food even harder for the thousands of Vermonters and millions of Americans working hard to stay healthy while covering their bills and keeping the heat on. Instead of proposing to cut 3SquaresVT, I urge you to work to increase wages and improve access to housing, healthcare, and food assistance programs like 3SquaresVT.

While some households would see a small increase in benefits under the proposal, nearly 1/5 of SNAP households would experience an average monthly benefit cut of $30 per month, Dean tweeted, according to Common Dreams. That can be days or weeks worth of groceries."

I am writing today in strong opposition to the proposed rule on SNAP Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances which would negatively impact families and individuals across Minnesota. 

I oppose this rule change because it would force Minnesotans to choose between food or heat which are both equally important basic necessities especially when we experience below zero temperatures for months on end during the winter in Minnesota. This extra strain on families would drastically impact their well-being, sense of security and ability to cope with our dangerously cold winters while keeping food on the table. As a SNAP Outreach Coordinator and operator of our statewide food resources helpline at Hunger Solutions Minnesota, I speak with over 100 Minnesotans each week struggling to find resources available to them to help make ends meat for themselves and their families. The need for food resources is only increasing as aging populations are living solely off of social security benefits. To force our elderly to choose between food and heat is unheard of. Please do not let this proposed rule change that would disproportionately impact Minnesotans' ability to survive and provide for themselves and their families in times of need get passed. This rule change is dangerous for Minnesota and communities across the country.

Winters deathly cold temperatures in North Dakota last much much longer than other states. This change would not simply be a temporary burden on those in need. This change (decrease in the SNAP benefits) would negatively impact those in need much longer than the normal 4-5 month period. Many those in need are working families that don't make a decent full-time working wage, due to businesses having to cut back on hiring, wage increases and product/services due to the White House's Administration's unplanned and poorly executed TARIFF wars. Many of these families are in the farming and ranching industries, or related businesses.

09000064841d8e6b,25,1,27,1,"Dear SNAP Certification Policy Branch:

On behalf of Transitions Clinic Network, I appreciate the opportunity to comment on USDA's Notice of Proposed Rule Making, the ""Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program: Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances, which was published in the federal register on October 3, 2019. 

We strongly oppose the changes proposed by USDA to alter the methodology for calculating standard utility allowances, because of the significant harm the change would inflict on California's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participants. According to the Department's own estimates, the proposed rule would lower monthly SNAP benefits for 25 percent of participating California households; disproportionately harm seniors and people with disabilities; and cause a national net cut to SNAP benefits, amounting to $4.5 billion over five years. As with previously proposed rules, the Administration's estimates likely do not take into account the full range of harm caused by the proposed policy. Better and more recent data is needed to accurately estimate the rule's impact on California. It is clear that USDA's proposed cuts would have harmful impacts on the health and well-being of Californians and our economy while exacerbating the existing struggles many low-income Californians face in paying for food and utilities. We believe the proposed rule is misguided, flawed, and should be withdrawn. 

Transitions Clinic Network is a national non-profit that supports primary care clinics in implementing special programs from individuals with chronic health conditions returning to the community from incarceration. We have worked with 21 clinics in California and 39 nationally to implement this program. In a large research study, we found that 25% of our clients nationally experienced extreme food insecurityover 24 hours without food. Most of the individuals who are eligible for care in our programs are older and have more than one chronic health condition. They rely on SNAP benefits to survive. Without these benefits, their health and reentry outcomes would worsen.

Benefit levels for SNAP are based on income and other factors including utility expenses, which can often be deducted from a low-income household's gross income. Policymakers have long recognized that when households use their already limited resources to pay for basics such as housing, child care, and utilities it impacts their ability to purchase food. Under current law, SNAP takes into account these expenses, including the costs of utilities for each SNAP household, to better reflect participant's true cost of living and to more accurately assess their food assistance needs. For utilities, states adjust household benefits based on a state-specific Standard Utility Allowance (SUA), calculated by the state and approved by USDA. The current policy allows variances in SUAs to accommodate for differences in utility costs and rates, and allows states necessary flexibility in how they calculate those costs. 

The proposed rule would standardize and cap SUA calculations across the country based on survey data. The proposed rule does not adequately explain USDA's rationale for capping the largest of the SUA components by calibrating to utility expense survey data for those no higher than the 80th percentile of low-income people and then capping other SUA components as well. The proposed rule merely asserts that it calculated calibrating to the 50th percentile compared to the 80th percentile. The proposed rule does not adequately explain whether USDA analyzed impacts calibrated to the 85th or higher percentiles and what the results of those estimates were. The lack of such explanation is particularly concerning given research documented that 21 states had SUAs exceeding the 85th percentile estimates, possibly because in their efforts to mitigate benefit loss for households with very high utility costs. 

This USDA rulemaking is yet another attempt for the Administration to side step Congress and make cuts to SNAP benefits. Congress reviewed SNAP policy during the 2018 Farm Bill, including the fact that states have options that may produce differences in SNAP eligibility benefit amounts from state to state. Although the President's FY 2019 Budget included a request for a change similar to the proposed rule, Congress did not include such a change in the 2018 Farm Bill. Indeed, evening out benefit amounts across states by lowering benefits for large numbers of participants does not promote and instead undermines SNAP's statutory purpose.

USDA should be strengthening the positive impacts of SNAP for health, well-being and economic activity, not making cuts to SNAP benefits. We strongly oppose the proposed rule and request the USDA withdraw the rule and work with states to improve their SUA's under existing flexibility.

09000064841d3447,25,2,27,2,"To Whom It May Concern: 

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Food and Nutrition Services (FNS) Notice of Public Rule Making (NPRM) for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program: Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances published on October 3, 2019. As a public health practitioner and researcher, I am deeply troubled by the proposed rule and my comments express strong opposition to this rule change. This proposal is one component of a sustained and systematic effort to undermine SNAP, a federal food assistance program serving low-income Americans affected by hunger. SNAP provides almost 40 million Americans with a vital safety net that increases food security, reduces poverty, and improves health outcomes. I am deeply saddened to see efforts to destabilize a program that addresses basic needs for children, older adults, and economically vulnerable populations across the country.

I have been fortunate enough to work to improve health and reduce disease at the federal, state, and local levels, working alongside dedicated public health professionals at the Centers for Disease Control, the New Hampshire Division of Public Health Services, and Public Health  Seattle & King County. In these roles, as well as through my Master of Public Health training and my current research as a sociology PhD student at Syracuse University, I have seen both rigorous data and heart-wrenching personal stories affirming a basic truth of public healththat social factors, far more than healthcare, determine how long and healthy peoples lives will be. Without basic economic security, and especially without access to adequate and nutritious food, an individuals risk of disease increases dramatically. Specific debilitating effects of food insecurity includes delayed development and underperformance in school for your children, mental and behavioral issues, chronic disease, unemployment, and premature death. It is a basic social justice issue to ensure that citizens of the wealthiest country in the world are not going hungry. In addition, supporting programs like SNAP that improve food affordability and availability will improve population health, reducing healthcare costs and allowing millions to contribute positively to the economy and their community. 

The current policy requires that individual states use a Standard Utility Allowance (SUA), or the states average utility cost, to calculate a households total shelter costs and determine their monthly SNAP benefit. The proposed rule change would standardize and cap SUA calculations across the country, undermining states flexibility, failing to account for regional differences in utility costs, rates, and usage, and exacerbating financial hardship for households with high utilities costs. This proposed rule would financially burden the very people who are most in need of support, targeting those with the fewest financial resources and the greatest vulnerability. This proposed rule will cut SNAP by $4.5 billion over 5 years, with disproportionate negative impacts on older adults, people with disabilities, and working families. For some, the proposed rule would reduce benefits, and for others SNAP eligibility would be lost completely. 

For the reasons discussed above and many others, I strongly urge you to withdraw this proposal in full immediately in order to avoid harmful impacts on the health and well-being of over seven million Americans, including three million children.
Sincerely,
Claire Pendergrast, MPH

090000648413c448,28,1,31,1,"Dear SNAP Program Design Branch:
 
I am writing to comment on USDAs Notice of Proposed Rule regarding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances - RIN 0584-AE69. According to the Departments own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years. I beg you to reconsider; if it goes into effect, this will cause serious harm to Vermonters in my community, as well as people across the country. The proposed rule should be withdrawn.

In Vermont, we call SNAP benefits 3SquaresVT, although many of my community neighbors still call it Food Stamps.  Most of the people I know who receive 3SVT are either working or on very fixed incomes. Our rural state is beautiful, but very cold in the winter, and very expensive to live in. We have very few industries here, so many, many Vermonters work hard at fairly low-paying jobs. 3SVT really helps keep them from hunger! Every study ever done shows that SNAP can help Vermonters afford enough food for themselves and their families, pull people out of poverty, help people learn and find and keep jobs, and improve health, both in the short term and in the long term. Studies aside, I know that several Seniors in my local church are able to afford to live in their homes because of the extra help from 3SVT. Why would you want to weaken a program that is proven to help people buy more and better food?!

If this rule goes through, then 26,000 Vermont households would experience an $82 cut in their 3SquaresVT benefits; thats over 3 in 5 3SquaresVT households, with Seniors and folks with disabilities taking the biggest hits. Additionally, a waning tide sinks all boats; with nearly $26 million fewer dollars per year coming into our state to help people in need buy more and better food, our local retailers and state economy would be harmed. This is simply unacceptable. 

Instead of proposing to cut 3SquaresVT, I urge you to work to increase wages and improve access to housing, healthcare, and food assistance programs like 3SquaresVT. They make a huge difference in the lives of low-income Vermonters and the health of our state (and nation) as a whole, and should remain strong and accessible.

3SquaresVT (our states name for SNAP) is Vermonts first line of defense against hunger. Make no mistake; we have serious poverty and hunger in Vermont. My children's friends, my neighbors, and my community members rely on this assistance to help them pull themselves out of poverty.

On average, Vermont households would receive a cut in their 3SquaresVT benefits, on average losing $82 per month for food; thats over 3 in 5 3SquaresVT households. It would harm older Vermonters and people with disabilities at an even higher rate; 80 percent of these households would receive a cut.

09000064841249bf,44,2,48,2,Let's take care of the most vulnerable people in our midst. That's the right thing to do.
09000064841d7da6,45,1,49,1,"Dear Secretary Perdue,

I am writing to oppose the cut to SNAP by restricting States' ability to set their own heating and cooling standard utility allowances. The proposal would force families struggling with hunger to choose between heating or cooling their homes and putting food on the table.

i find it incredibly ironic that the Republican administration, which used to espouse states' rights, is now issuing a proposed rule that would take away flexibility from the states and instead impose a ""federal government knows best"" approach.

In addition, by reducing SNAP benefits to low-income working families, I worry that this proposal could worsen our country's obesity epidemic by forcing families to choose lower nutrition food because they are often less expensive than healthier foods.

Finally, it is simply morally wrong to put vulnerable people in a position of having to choose between hunger and heating/cooling.

Please withdraw this ill-advised rule.

090000648411975a,45,2,49,2,"Dear Secretary Perdue, 

I oppose the cut to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by restricting of States ability to set their own heating and cooling standard utility allowances. The proposal would force families struggling with hunger to choose between heating or cooling their homes and putting food on the table.

Our government needs to find ways to further help these families, not make life harder for them. The more we can help struggling families, the better it is for the entire nation and the economy. Multiple studies have repeatedly shown this.

Do to implement this cruel and lose-lose proposal."

0900006484154b65,50,2,53,2,"As an individual working in the human services field, many consumers rely on 3Squares to put food on the table.  This not only disrupts food security among individuals, but also drastically damages the food economy, resulting in increasing prices in food, making it more difficult for families struggling to financially afford food.  As a result, poor food choices, which are often less expensive alternatives, may be made, which may result in increase medical costs (Medicaid) due to issues accompanied by poor food choices.  This may actually result in a higher insurance payout in addition to the issues of food insecurity.  Therefore, I oppose the idea of cutting SNAP benefits for eligible families."

Therefor I strongly oppose the proposed rule and insist the USDA withdraw it from further consideration. The proposed rule is an attempt to cut money spent on SNAP on the backs of millions of Americans who live in higher utility cost regions. But why cut SNAP at all?

Sonny Perdue, RIN: 0584-AE69; Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program: Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances A lot of people are barely making ends meet, with every penny needed. Children go hungry, utilities are shut down, clothes and shoes are ragged, and life is barely worth living. People suffer, and decision makers have no business taking resources away from them. People in the margins will die. You cannot understand the desperation unless you have been there. The Trump administrations proposed rule -- standardizing and capping Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) calculations across the country does not accommodate for differences in utility costs and rates and would result in dramatic cuts to the SNAP food stamps program. The administrations own data concedes that the proposed rule would cause 19 percent of SNAP households to get lower SNAP monthly benefits. This would disproportionately impact seniors and people with disabilities, and would cause a $4.5 billion cut -- over five years -- to SNAP benefits. The current policy, on the other hand, allows states flexibility in how they calculate the costs of SUAs to accommodate for variances from one state to the next. States must be allowed to calculate the costs of utilities as they account for SNAP benefits. I strongly oppose the USDAs new, proposed rule. Please withdraw the rule from further consideration.

I currently depend on SNAP benefits, without which I would eventually starve and die.

If theres any chance that new legislation would cause my monthly SNAP benefit to drop, then I would definitely oppose it. I would consider any such legislation unfair, as a former federal employee with over 20 years service in support of our military members overseas, who has fallen on hard times.

The standardization of heating & cooling utility allowance does not recognize the reality that utility expenses can vary drastically--even in the same area--based on a number of factors, including type of heating utilized, insulation factors, etc. Lower utility expense allowances would reduce SNAP benefits for those who most need this assistance. Housing, utilities and childcare are other expenses that must be considered--the amount paid on these takes away for the potential amount available to buy food!

Many families depend on the SNAP program for their survival. Cuts to important programs like SNAP, will have a devastating impact on millions of americans. The Trump administrations proposed rule -- standardizing and capping Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) calculations across the country does not accommodate for differences in utility costs and rates and would result in dramatic cuts to the SNAP food stamps program. The administrations own data concedes that the proposed rule would cause 19 percent of SNAP households to get lower SNAP monthly benefits. This would disproportionately impact seniors and people with disabilities, and would cause a $4.5 billion cut -- over five years -- to SNAP benefits. The current policy, on the other hand, allows states flexibility in how they calculate the costs of SUAs to accommodate for variances from one state to the next. States must be allowed to calculate the costs of utilities as they account for SNAP benefits. I strongly oppose the USDAs new, proposed rule.

Re:  Notice of Proposed Rule Making Regarding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances -- RIN 0584-AE69
 
Dear SNAP Program Design Branch:
 
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on USDA's Notice of Proposed Rule regarding (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances. 

I want to voice my strong opposition to this proposal; if it goes into effect, this will cause serious harm to Vermonters in my community, Vermonters I personally know as family and friends, as well as people across the country. The proposed rule should be withdrawn.

3SquaresVT (our state's name for SNAP) is Vermont's first line of defense against hunger. It helps Vermonters afford enough food for themselves and their families, pulls people out of poverty, helps people learn and find and keep jobs, and improves health, both in the short term and in the long term. This program helped my aunt and uncle keep heat on in the winter and with providing enough food to their children when they had two young children. Despite being two working parents, one of which had just completed military service, the cost of living exceeded their income, which is common in many Vermont communities. This problem is exacerbated by increased rent in urban centers like Burlington, and long commute distances in rural areas. I have personally known dozens of people in my life who used SNAP to survive the winter (which is often -20 degrees Fahrenheit in the mountains in January, I note this to demonstrate that access to heating is crucial.  

According to estimates from Vermont's Department for Children and Families (the agency that administers 3SquaresVT), this rule would mean that 26,000 Vermont households would receive a cut in their 3SquaresVT benefits, on average losing $82 per month for food; that's over 3 in 5 3SquaresVT households. It would harm older Vermonters and people with disabilities at an even higher rate; 80 percent of these households would receive a cut. Additionally, with nearly $26 million fewer dollars per year coming into our state to help people in need buy more and better food, our local retailers and state economy would be harmed. This is unacceptable in my community. This will directly harm four of my personal friends, five of my elderly family members, and I know of dozens of elderly people in my Vermont hometown who will be impacted. In my current city, hundreds of people will be harmed by this rule. 

The harm this rule will cause is literally life-threatening. It is not a matter of simply low-income Vermonters going into debt to survive, but impacts direct survival as without adequate heating, winter conditions in this state are deadly. Even for those who manage to keep their heat on, they may keep the heat low and eat less, which is dangerous for the elderly, disabled people, young children, and those with medical conditions that rely on SNAP. 

Especially at this time of year, it is cruel and misguided to attempt to weaken a program that is proven to help people buy more and better food. Please don't make accessing food even harder for the thousands of Vermonters and millions of Americans working hard to stay healthy while covering their bills and keeping the heat on. Instead of proposing to cut 3SquaresVT, I urge you to work to increase wages and improve access to housing, healthcare, and food assistance programs like 3SquaresVT. They make a huge difference in the lives of low-income Vermonters and the health of our state as a whole, and should remain strong and accessible.

Re:  Notice of Proposed Rule Making Regarding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances -- RIN 0584-AE69
 
To the members of the SNAP Program Design Branch:
 
I am writing to comment on, and express my strong opposition to, USDA's Notice of Proposed Rule regarding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances. As a citizen and someone with many low-income members of my family, I believe that the proposed rule should be withdrawn.  According to the Department's own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years. If it goes into effect, this will cause serious harm to people in my community, as well as to people across the country.

3SquaresVT (SNAP in Vermont) helps many thousands of Vermonters afford enough food for themselves and their families.  There is a great deal of research that shows SNAP pulls people out of poverty, helps people find and keep jobs, keeps families together, and improves health, both in the short term and in the long term.  My own 74-year-old mother is a perfect example.  She has worked her whole life, and is still working.  She served many foster children, and elderly and sick people throughout her lifejobs that pay very little and made it very difficult for her to save.  If it wasn't for me providing her with housing and financial help, she would be destitute.  She has used SNAP at times in her life, and it has made a huge difference, even though she never qualified for more than the minimum benefit.  Under these new proposed rule changes, it is likely she would not qualify for a benefit at all.  My immediate family is luckymy spouse and I have good paying jobs and can support my mother.  Most families in the U.S. don't have that luxury, especially as the cost of housing and food and utilities keep rising.  What is gained by making it even harderespecially for the elderly and the disabledto buy food and stay healthy?  I would think it would cost far more to have our Medicare and Medicaid systems address their increased health problems due to a lack of proper nutrition.

According to estimates from Vermont's Department for Children and Families (the agency that administers 3SquaresVT), this rule would mean that 26,000 Vermont households would receive a cut in their 3SquaresVT benefits, on average losing $82 per month for food; that's over 3 in 5 3SquaresVT households. It would harm older Vermonters and people with disabilities at an even higher rate; 80 percent of these households would receive a cut. Additionally, with nearly $26 million fewer dollars per year coming into our state to help people in need buy more and better food, our local retailers and state economy would be harmed. This is unacceptable.  We need every available job in Vermont right now, and this proposal would also harm many small businesses in Vermont, which also happen to be the only stores selling food in many of our small towns.

In a rural and cold-weather state like Vermont, people who struggle to make ends meet have a lot of obstacles to overcome. Especially at this time of year, it is cruel and misguided to attempt to weaken a program that is proven to help people buy more and better food. Please don't make accessing food even harder for the thousands of Vermonters and millions of Americans working hard to stay healthy while covering their bills and keeping the heat on. Instead of proposing to cut 3SquaresVT, I urge you to work to increase wages and improve access to housing, healthcare, and food assistance programs like 3SquaresVT. They make a huge difference in the lives of low-income Vermonters and the health of our state as a whole, and should remain strong and accessible.

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on USDA's Notice of Proposed Rule regarding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances.

As an educator in Vermont I see the effects of food insecurity every day.  My students are set up for failure if they aren't given the tools to be ready to learn. One huge tool is healthy food and enough food. If their family is worried about having enough food, then they are also worried and can't focus on school. It's quite depressing to me that we find money to support many other initiatives at the expense of the most vulnerable people.

3SquaresVT (our state's name for SNAP) is Vermont's first line of defense against hunger. It helps Vermonters afford enough food for themselves and their families, pulls people out of poverty, helps people learn and find and keep jobs, and improves health, both in the short term and in the long term. For the past six and a half years, I have worked for an organization called Hunger Free Vermont, whose mission is to fight the injustice of hunger and malnutrition for all Vermonters. Much of my position revolves around SNAP - ensuring that eligible Vermonters are aware of the program and able to apply, working with state and federal partners to remove undue barriers to access and participation, and now fighting threat after threat to the program. I know that this program is essential for thousands of members of my community because I see its impacts firsthand - for many of them, it is their only money for food, and it's already not enough. SNAP means that a woman in the Northeast Kingdom can feed herself in addition to her grandson, that a family in Rutland can run their heater all winter, that a disabled Vermonter in Brattleboro can live independently, and that an older adult in Barre can afford more than tea and toast. It's easy to think of this program in numbers and dollar figures, but that's only part of the story. SNAP keeps people healthy, thriving, and alive. It is our duty to make sure it does this, and does this well.

According to estimates from Vermont's Department for Children and Families (the agency that administers SNAP), this rule would mean that 26,000 Vermont households would receive a cut in their SNAP benefits, on average losing $82 per month for food; that's over 3 in 5 SNAP households. It would harm older Vermonters and people with disabilities at an even higher rate; 80 percent of these households would receive a cut. Additionally, with nearly $26 million fewer dollars per year coming into our state to help people in need buy more and better food, our local retailers and state economy would be harmed. This is unacceptable in my community. 

During this public comment period, I have heard from so many Vermonters who are touched by this program; they are frustrated, outraged, and confused, but mostly, they're afraid. Afraid of what will happen if this proposal goes into effect. One woman I spoke to today was in tears; she said that if she loses her SNAP benefits she doesn't know how she will be able to live. What should I say to her? I'm not sure a discussion of the merits of different SUA methodologies will provide any comfort. 

In a rural and cold-weather state like Vermont, people who struggle to make ends meet have a lot of obstacles to overcome. Especially at this time of year, it is cruel and misguided to attempt to weaken a program that is proven to help people buy more and better food. Please don't make accessing food even harder for the thousands of Vermonters and millions of Americans working hard to stay healthy while covering their bills and keeping the heat on. Instead of proposing to cut SNAP, I urge you to work to increase wages and improve access to housing, healthcare, and food assistance programs like SNAP. They make a huge difference in the lives of low-income Vermonters and the health of our state as a whole, and should remain strong and accessible.

I want to voice my strong opposition to this proposal; if it goes into effect, this will cause serious harm to Vermonters in my community, as well as people across the country.

It helps Vermonters afford enough food for themselves and their families, pulls people out of poverty, helps people learn and find and keep jobs, and improves health, both in the short term and in the long term. This program is so incredibly important in providing healthy food to the food-insecure population my hospital serves. According to estimates from Vermonts Department for Children and Families (the agency that administers 3SquaresVT), this rule would mean that 26,000 Vermont households would receive a cut in their 3SquaresVT benefits, on average losing $82 per month for food; thats over 3 in 5 3SquaresVT households. It would harm older Vermonters and people with disabilities at an even higher rate; 80 percent of these households would receive a cut. Additionally, with nearly $26 million fewer dollars per year coming into our state to help people in need buy more and better food, our local retailers and state economy would be harmed. This is unacceptable in my community. As a Registered Dietitian, many of the patients I see rely on programs, such as this, to provide them with healthy and nutritious foods. In a rural and cold-weather state like Vermont, people who struggle to make ends meet have a lot of obstacles to overcome. Especially at this time of year, it is cruel and misguided to attempt to weaken a program that is proven to help people buy more and better food. Please dont make accessing food even harder for the thousands of Vermonters and millions of Americans working hard to stay healthy while covering their bills and keeping the heat on. Instead of proposing to cut 3SquaresVT, I urge you to work to increase wages and improve access to housing, healthcare, and food assistance programs like 3SquaresVT. They make a huge difference in the lives of low-income Vermonters and the health of our state as a whole, and should remain strong and accessible. Sincerely,"

Sonny Perdue, RIN: 0584-AE69; Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program: Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances It is a disgrace that the richest country in the world would even consider cutting funds that help feed some of the most vulnerable American people. Not only would it affect the most vulnerable among us, it would deprive students of needed nutrition to help them adequately learn in school. People are not on public assistance for the fun of it. Do not make their lives even harder by withholding nutrition. If our government is so hard up they are considering cutting food assistance, then start taxing corporations and the rich to help out. This is a disgrace! The Trump administrations proposed rule -- standardizing and capping Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) calculations across the country does not accommodate for differences in utility costs and rates and would result in dramatic cuts to the SNAP food stamps program. The administrations own data concedes that the proposed rule would cause 19 percent of SNAP households to get lower SNAP monthly benefits. This would disproportionately impact seniors and people with disabilities, and would cause a $4.5 billion cut -- over five years -- to SNAP benefits. The current policy, on the other hand, allows states flexibility in how they calculate the costs of SUAs to accommodate for variances from one state to the next. States must be allowed to calculate the costs of utilities as they account for SNAP benefits. I strongly oppose the USDAs new, proposed rule. Please withdraw the rule from further consideration.

09000064841dafb2,81,1,75,1,"I am writing on behalf of Lutheran Metropolitan Ministry in response to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's proposal to standardize the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program's (SNAP) Standard Utility Allowances (SUA).  If enacted, the rule would have a doubly negative impact in Ohio. It would reduce the average amount of SNAP benefits received monthly for approximately 41% of recipients while contributing to $250 million in annual economic activity loses. We strongly oppose the proposed formula changes and urge the Department of Agriculture to withdraw the rule. 

Lutheran Metropolitan Ministry (LMM) is a 50-year-old non-profit providing innovative social enterprise job-training, civic engagement strategies and safety net services for the City of Cleveland and across Northeast Ohio. Our mission leads us to operate programs that change lives, transform communities and enliven community engagement. LMM provides guardianship services to over 800 individuals deemed incompetent by the courts, runs a social enterprise that provides culinary training to women currently incarcerated so when released, they have the skills needed for employment, manages a youth shelter and two youth independent living sites, and provides mental health services to clients participating in LMM programs. In addition to these services, LMM operates the Men's Shelter at 2100 Lakeside in downtown Cleveland, Ohio's largest emergency shelter which serves an average of 400 men per night, and operates the Haven Home, an overflow shelter that serves up to 80 women and children. In 2018, we served more than 7,000 individuals across our five service areas. It is our experience serving these individuals that leads LMM to comment on the currently proposed rule.  

As part of the SNAP program, recipients are awarded a SUA to cover a household's heating and utility expenses. We are concerned that the proposed rule, which would standardize the eligible deduction nationwide, will lead to a reduction in SNAP benefits in some households, thereby forcing individuals to choose between food and utilities. Food is one of the greatest needs for residents in Ohio. Nearly 1.7 million Ohioans (14.5% of the population) are food insecure and 83% live below the Federal poverty line. In Cuyahoga County where LMM is located, 18.6 percent of households qualify for SNAP. This exceeds Ohio's statewide averages for metro areas (14.6 percent), small towns (15.6 percent) and rural areas (15.6 percent).   

It is therefore alarming that Ohio is one of sixteen states hardest hit by the formula change. Under the proposed rule 41% of Ohioans who receive SNAP would lose out on benefits. Of those who do lose benefits, recipients would lose an average of $45 a month - or $540 a year. This is significant as the average SNAP recipient receives average monthly benefits of $126.   

We are also concerned regarding the impact that this rule would have on older Ohioans. Ohio is one of the 10 worst states for hunger for older adults. More than 1 in 6 older adults (18 percent) of those 60 and older face hunger. In the past 5 years, the percent of seniors in Cuyahoga County who qualify for SNAP increased by 20 percent which is likely a result of the county's rapidly aging population; by 2030, 31 percent of Cuyahoga County will be 60 years of age and older.  

According to USDA Food and Nutrition Services estimates, under the proposed rule, Ohio's SUA would be cut by an estimated 31%, or $155. Households with seniors and/or individuals with disabilities, as well as families with especially high shelter costs are likely to see the biggest benefit cuts, since they benefit most from SNAP's shelter expense deduction.  

Lastly, in addition to the negative impact this rule change would have on vulnerable Ohioans, the rule change would have adverse effects on Ohio's economy. This rule would leave Ohio to lose $144 million per year in SNAP benefits which translates to nearly $250 million in losses in annual economic activity. SNAP provides $168 million worth of groceries per month to Ohio, and roughly $2 billion per year. This formula change could cause widespread grocery store closures in communities with high SNAP usage, lost jobs, and the creation of new food deserts. 

Due to the clear negative impact on Ohioans and Ohio's economy, we ask that the Administration reconsider this proposed rule. If implemented, it will put families in the precarious position of having to decide between heating or cooling their homes and putting food on the table.

09000064841bcb0c,85,1,78,1,"To the US Department of Agriculture,

I am very much apposed to the proposal that would cut SNAP benefits for millions of Americans.  This proposal would have a particularly harmful impact in Colorado, where the cost of utilities and shelter is often higher than other states.  These cuts would:
1) Reduce food budgets for 40% of Colorado SNAP households when benefits are already too low 
2) Hurt the health and well-being of Coloradans  
3) Weaken Colorados economy 
4) Exacerbate the struggle of affording both food and utilities for many low-income families  
5) Harm older adults and people with disabilities 

I want to tell you about Larisa who is a former student of mine at Arvada West High School.  She suffers from Common Variable Immune Deficiency (CVID), which is a disorder characterized by low levels of serum immunoglobulins (antibodies) and an increased susceptibility to infections. The exact cause of the low levels of serum immunoglobulins is usually not known. It is a relatively common form of immunodeficiency, hence, the word common. 

These are a lot of big words  what I can tell you is that Larisa needs to receive plasma injections every three weeks just to stay alive.  She is dairy and gluten intolerant, so she has to be very careful with her diet, and she can suffer from infections just by shopping at Target or Costco.  She typically visits her platoon of doctors over 100 times per year just to monitor and try to maintain her health.

She was a very successful professional who most recently served as the Executive Director of the Rocky Mountain Masonry Institute in Denver.   She had to give up her career, and currently barely maintains her compromised life style through her eligibility for Medicare/Social Security Disability Insurance, which is a pittance of what she was earning when she was able to work.  

She also receives help from SNAP.  Please do not cut off people like Larisa that need this kind of help and support."
09000064841bd632,85,2,78,2,"I oppose the proposal to standardize how states account for utility costs for the following reasons:

1. It would reduce food budgets for 40% of Colorado SNAP households when benefits are already too low. 
2. It would hurt the health and well-being of Coloradans  
3. It would weaken Colorados economy. 
4. It would exacerbate the struggle of affording both food and utilities for many low-income families  
5. It would harm older adults and people with disabilities."
09000064841c030e,86,1,79,1,"Working as a Registered Dietitian a huge amount of my patients rely on the SNAP program.  The program allows my patients access to healthy foods. It would significantly exacerbate the serious struggles low-income families face choosing between food and utilities. Without SNAP benefits my patients will have to choose low cost, nutrient poor foods that continue to contribute to morbid obesity and diabetes and drain our healthcare system. It will disproportionally impact the elderly and those with disabilities. Please re-consider this very serious and detrimental proposal."
090000648410b9bb,86,2,79,2,"I am very concerned with the proposed rule changes for SNAP.  This would cause a great deal of harm to those who already struggle to live in a dignified manner and provide the basics for themselves and their families.  I am particularly concerned for the elderly and disabled who would be affected by this proposal.  No one wins when the health and well-being of the most vulnerable members of society are compromised.  For ethical, financial and moral reasons, I ask that you reconsider this proposal; food assistance is critical to all families.  Let us as a nation recognize that those who receive SNAP benefits are every bit as much American and every bit as much God's children as anyone else.  Please do not make life even more difficult for them and their families."

Massachusetts, the state where I live, has areas with extremely high utilities costs, that would not be accurately represented by a standardized estimate, and many people that rely on SNAP so they do not have to choose between food and shelter would lose that safety net.

So many people struggle just to feed themselves and their families. Work here tends to be seasonal and not well paid. People drive long distances just to buy groceries. SNAPs statutory purpose, as declared by Congress, is to promote the general welfare, to safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation's population by raising levels of nutrition among low-income households. We call on the USDA to reject the rule thats up for consideration to help preserve the essential mission of SNAP. This rule unfairly cuts $4.5 billion from low-income families who need it most by undermining the ability of each state to determine the factors and utility costs they are using to determine eligibility.

The San Francisco Bay area where I live has extreme variations of wealth and poverty. Every day I see homeless encampments. The local state university, San Jose State, has over 4000 homeless students. Numbers of people coming to food pantries and free meal programs continues to rise. If cost of living is included, our poverty rate is similar to that of Mississippi's.

The main reason for hunger and poverty in my area is lack of affordable housing. Rents are rising faster than people's ability to pay. It costs at least $650 per month just to rent a room! There are plenty of low wage jobs, but they don't pay a living wage. It will take years before supply and demand come into balance, and children and families need help NOW.

The proposed standardization of heating and cooling allowances will hit this area even harder than most. Our main utility provider, Pacific Gas and Electric, has raised its rates due to extensive fire losses and other costs. It is currently in bankruptcy, and utility rates are expected to increase even further.

Our healthcare in the USA is one of the lowest in the developed world, this proposal could lead to a devastating epidemic already disadvantaged people's health and wellness is further compromised. This epidemic would be devastating to the economy impacting so many sectors who depend on low wages work or local dollars to thrive.

It will also cause 19 percent of SNAP households to get lower SNAP monthly benefits which many people cannot afford. It will disproportionately impact elderly people and people with disabilities such as myself. 

I ask that you please reconsider and support the working class and avoid us going into a nationwide epidemic.

SNAP is a critical safety net program for seniors, children, people with disabilities and low-income workers. The program plays a critical role in addressing hunger and food insecurity in Missouri, helping 375,465 households put meals on the table. SNAP helps 1 in 6 rural households and 1 in 8 households in metro areas in Missouri afford healthy, nutritious meals. Over three-quarters of households depending on SNAP are working families and 45% are families with children who depend on SNAP. Older Missourians also depend on SNAP to keep food on their tables with 8.5% of households with seniors face food insecurity.

The sometimes devastating effects of food insecurity, which will only worsen and become more widespread if SNAP benefits are cut, including skipping meals, choosing between food or medicine, postponing medical care, skyrocketing medical costs, children falling behind in school, and more.

My organization - Peace Church - represent people who may lose their food assistance benefits if the proposed rule becomes law. Loss of SNAP would have significant consequences for my members and their families, including negative health outcomes and increased economic insecurity, particularly for those already struggling with the high cost of health care, food and utility costs. 

Good nutrition is essential for the health and well-being and development of children and families and serves as a lifeline for seniors and people with disabilities who live on restricted incomes. SNAP is also linked to lower health care costs and greater economic security.  Loss of the SNAP benefits would have a harmful impact not only on them but as well as on the economy.   

I have worked for organizations that provide residential services for developmentally disabled adults, who were dependent on SNAP and other food assistance programming in order to insure adequate nutrition. Access to adequate nutrition is a basic human right that our government should support completely.

By USDA's own estimates, this proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion in over 5 years, potentially cutting benefits for 19% of SNAP households nationally and impacting 375,465 households in Missouri. Low-income people should not have to make a decision about whether to pay for heating or cooling or whether to pay for food. Nor should they forsake their health care needs in order to meet their food insecurity needs. 

There has long been an effective relationship between the federal government that funds SNAP and the states, which administer the program but the proposed rule change on SUA undermines that relationship. The proposed rule would standardize and cap SUA across the states based on survey data but without input from state experts who have the greatest insights into utility costs in the state as well as factors that could impact these costs including changes in climate and other local context. 

We ask that the Administration reject the latest proposed rule change and instead, preserve the existing process that allows state input and flexibility in determining the Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) in calculating SNAP benefits.
