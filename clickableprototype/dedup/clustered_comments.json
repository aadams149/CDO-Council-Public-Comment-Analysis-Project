Here in my own community, more than 7,000 people are in need of weekly food assistance due to poverty, homelessness, children without parents or guardians, working poor struggling to make ends meet. SNAP benefits are essential to survival. These are not \"lazy\" people. These are people who need a hand-up to make it in our society. SNAP benefits are a critical part of a healthy family, which translates to healthy kids in school systems, less dependence upon welfare in the long run, and a better chance they will succeed in life in the long run. Cutting benefits for short term political gain will seriously harm children and families for years to come.

My friend works 45 hours a week as a CNA, often the 3 3-11 shift so she doesn't see much of her son. She stilll supports both her son and her daughter who is in college, fortunately with deserved scholarships. Their father has not paid support for the daughter for two years, and, in August, when the son turned 18 just before entering his senior year in high school, the father stopped paying support for him. My friend cannot put food on the table (do you know how much an 18 year old male eats?) without her full SNAP allowance. A big tax cut was given to the well off. Can't you at least give the hard working, low paid persons help feeding their children? The USDA must reject any changes to that rule.

It is ridiculous to give the wealthiest 1 % of people in the country a tax cut so they can buy more expensive food and then cut basic benefits so some people can have just the basics in nutrition. kids can't learn in school or develop social emotional skills (behavior), if the don't have enough to eat.

The personal identifying information of this commenter was redacted. Sonny Perdue, The idea of developing yet another policy that will have a negative impact on people who depend on SNAP benefits is abhorrent. Standardizing utility caps across the country is unfair and based on suspect data. Utility costs differ from state to state and region to region in most states. This concept will cause people to lose benefits and exacerbate food insecurity for many people. In a country with the riches and bounty that America has, people going hungry is shameful. Having a government that turns a blind eye and seeks to harm people is beyond shameless! I strongly oppose the proposed rule and demand the USDA withdraw it from further consideration. SNAP benefits, which would be substantially cut through this rule change, play a critical role in addressing hunger and food insecurity in our community. It is the first line of defense against hunger for low-income residents. Policymakers recognize that household resources needed to pay for basics such as shelter, utility costs and childcare are not available to purchase food. Under current law, SNAP takes into account the utility expenses of each SNAP household. States adjust household benefits based on a state-specific Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) calculated by the state and approved by USDA. The current policy allows variances in SUAs to accommodate for differences in utility costs and rates, and allows states flexibility in how they calculate those costs. The proposed rule, however, would standardize and cap SUA calculations across the country based on survey data -- resulting in dramatic cuts to SNAP.

Why not increase the standard so that more in need will receive help and give a better chance to those in need. If you want to regulate across the board set the standard to the highest cost areas so that more will benefit and no one left out.

Sonny Perdue, Dear Secretary Sonny Perdue, The Trump Administrations proposal to standardize and cap Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) calculations across the country fails to recognize regional differences in climate & expenses for utilities and could dramatically harm vulnerable Americans. Although I am a Republican & a fiscal conservative who has never received food stamps, I oppose this proposal because it fails to provide for the general welfare and to promote the common defense of Americans guaranteed by the Preamble of our Constitution. Even a cursory scanning of that document reveals the proposal to be morally & constitutionally deficient. Further, the Administrations own data reveals this proposal would cause 19 percent of households currently entitled to SNAP benefits to receive reduced monthly benefits. These reductions would disproportionately harm seniors and the disabled. While a reduction in Federal spending totaling $4.5 billion over five years is meritorious given the present explosion of the Federal deficit, reducing that deficit by burdening the most vulnerable Americans is criminal. It is time to send the idea back to committee & work with the Office of Budget & Management to determine genuinely sound means for reducing Federal spending. Sincerely, John A.

By making calculations more inflexible and centralized, the policy will become not only less effective, but less in line with best practices.

The personal identifying information of this commenter was redacted. I am writing to offer comments on the proposed rule to standardize the Standard Utility Allowances for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP. I am opposed the proposed change because it will reduce the benefit to American citizens experiencing food insecurity. Food, clothing and shelter represent the basic needs of all humans. We as a country of prosperity owe it to our fellow citizens to assure that these basic needs are available for all. The working poor are often forced to make desperate choices between housing and food, between medicine and food, between a winter coat for their children and food. This is not an acceptable reality. As a health care professional who has worked in a hospital for 40 years, I have personally witnessed the negative health consequences of malnutrition; health and wellness begin with food, clothing and shelter. It is only after these three basic needs are met that we can focus on education, employment and contributing to society. I urge you to reconsider the proposed changes to the SNAP SUA methodology as written as they will have the devastating effect of reducing food security for millions of American citizens. To quote the late Elijah Cummings, \"we are better than that\". Thank you for allowing me to comment on this important concern.

The rich need to start paying taxes so America's society because more stable economically or American society will no longer be a democracy.

It is in my opinion, he has no concept of what taking that oath means or stands for just like he does not no concept of the Constitution of the United States. It can easily be proven if the reports asked him about the Constitution, for he will not be able to answer. My guess, he never read it, just like all the other things that he has not read.

No household can find money for food unless they have already paid for shelter, utilities, etc. Many households are paid so little despite having more than one adult working several jobs, I am more than full-time, but they can only afford to pay for shelter and other necessities. If they didnt have SNAP benefits, it would not be able to afford food.

SNAP is our most critical and effective tool in providing food for hungry families - a basic human right. Rather than enacting more restrictions and cuts to SNAP like this proposed rule, we should be expanding eligibility and benefits to ensure that no one goes hungry.

This local flexibility is important because utility rates and costs are vastly different depending on where you live.

We are not talking about much money on an individual basis - I receive just enough to alleviate the pressure and stress of putting food on the table for me and my household.

I have seen first hand the effect of families being deprived of services. In East St. Louis, IL where I minister, there were two stores that offered a very limited choice of foods and junk foods. One was shut down at least 3 months ago, which gives our residents one tiny little store that charges an arm and a leg for groceries and other needs. So, even with SNAP, these people are getting the bare minimum. I see families working 2 and 3 jobs to make ends meet and start to get ahead. Please do not take away their support.

Since costs and rates vary significantly across the the US that flexibility is key to creating a fair and equitable program in each state.

Essential food-aid benefits to 7.2 million low -income people would be cut substantially.

This rule would exacerbate the struggles of many low-income people having difficulty paying for food and utilities.  It would have harmful impacts on their health and well-being as well as on the broader economy. \n\nThe Greater Chicago Food Depository works in partnership with 700 agencies and programs to distribute food throughout Cook County, Illinois. We support food pantries, soup kitchens, and shelters as well as targeted responses for children, older adults and veterans. Last year, we distributed 74.8 million pounds of food, the equivalent of 62 million meals. We also work to address the root cause of hunger through key initiatives, such as job training, benefits outreach, and policy and advocacy. \n\nThe Food Depository has a unique lens into how those experiencing food insecurity must make tough choices between paying for food, housing, utilities, medication, and other basic needs.

This lack of explanation is particularly concerning given research documented that 21 states had SUAs exceeding the 85th percentile estimates, possibly because in their efforts to mitigate benefit loss for households with very high utility costs. \n\nThe proposed rule does little more than ensure that more American families struggling to make ends meet will have to make tough choice between paying for food and other critical household expenses. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, nearly one-third of U.S. households experienced energy insecurity at one point or another. These households frequently make ends meet by forgoing other basics need in order to pay their utilities, such as experiencing temporary disconnections in services, or keeping their homes at unhealthy temperatures to manage their consumption.  More than one-third of Illinois households are considered low-income, meaning they earn less than $30,000 annually. Cutting SNAP benefits to families that are already struggling to pay for basic necessities will only increase the burden of choosing between keeping food in the table or keeping the lights on. The Administration concedes that the proposed rule would cause 19 percent of SNAP households to receive lower SNAP monthly benefits, would disproportionately impact elderly people and people with disabilities, and would cause a national net cut to SNAP benefits amounting to $4.5 billion over five years.\n\nThis USDA rulemaking is another attempt by the Administration to side step Congress and make cuts to SNAP benefits.  Congress reviewed SNAP policy during the 2018 Farm Bill, including the fact that states may exercise various options that may produce differences in SNAP eligibility and benefit amounts from state to state.  Although the Presidents fiscal year 2019 budget request included a change like the proposed SUA rule,  Congress rejected such a change in the 2018 Farm Bill.

This dangerous proposal would force more people onto the lines of the emergency food network whose resources are already stretched too thin.\n\nFood Bank For New York City is a major hunger relief organization serving the five boroughs of New York City. Our mission is to end hunger by organizing food, information and support for community survival, empowerment, and dignity. Our organization serves approximately 1.5 million New York City residents every year through a network of nearly 1,000 charities, community-based organizations and schools across the city. SNAP is our nation's first line of defense against hunger and plays a critical role in addressing hunger and food insecurity among low-income New Yorkers who struggle to put food on the table.  \n\nEvery year, through our SNAP outreach work, we assist thousands of low-income New York City residents to enroll in SNAP. 95% of the clients we reach through that service qualify for the Standard Utility Allowance. The current structure for Standard Utility Allowances works to account for regional differences in utility and cost of living in places like New York State where we experience a significantly higher utility costs - electricity alone was 54% higher in New York than the national average.  Because costs of living expenses like utilities, shelter, and personal care items often compete with food for the last dime of low-income residents household budgets, this proposal to force a one-sized-fits all structure would increase hunger among low-income people in our country. \n\nFood Bank For New York City is also the main supplier of food to our city's network of food pantries and soup kitchens, charities that consistently report food shortages. Indeed, more than half of food pantries and soup kitchens in New York City reported experiencing food shortages in October 2019.  We know all too well that charity cannot fill the gaps left behind when our federal anti-hunger policy supports are withdrawn. By USDA's estimates, this proposal would cut SNAP food assistance by $4.5 billion over five years. In New York nearly 450,000 SNAP households - nearly 1 in 3 - would see their benefits slashed on average of $63 per month in benefits. This cut would result in the loss of 9 million meals every month in a state that already experiences a Meal Gap of 385 million meals per year.  This loss of more than $345 million in food assistance benefits will pushing more of our neighbors onto the lines of emergency food providers.\n\nIf this rule were to go into effect, the health of low-income people would suffer. Healthy food items are both more expensive at grocery stores, and also more in need a food pantries and soup kitchens. Fresh fruit and vegetables are often the hardest items for charities to secure and often the most expensive items in our poorest communities: 73% of our network of emergency food providers report needing more fresh fruit and vegetables.  This proposal to take needed food resources away would further deny our poorest neighbors access to fresh fruit and vegetables - staples of a healthy diet and lifestyle.\nThe economic impact of this rule change would extend beyond the thousands of households who rely on SNAP for food, to business that rely on SNAP dollars. Every dollar spent in SNAP benefits adds $1.79 to the local economy - which, last year in New York City alone, equaled over $5 billion of economic activity in our own neighborhoods.\n\nIn 36 years of service to low income New Yorkers, we have provided more than 1.2 billion meals to New Yorkers in need. Our income support services, including SNAP enrollment and free tax assistance for the working poor, put more than $110 million each year into the pockets of New Yorkers, helping them to afford food and achieve greater dignity and independence. In addition, Food Bank's nutrition education programs and services empower more than 50,000 children, teens and adults to sustain a healthy diet on a limited budget. As one of our country's most robust anti-hunger organizations, we are deeply troubled by this proposal that would prevent thousands of New Yorkers from accessing the food they need to survive.

It would have harmful impacts on health and well-being as well as on the economy. The proposed rule is flawed and should be withdrawn.\n \nSNAP plays a critical role in addressing hunger and food insecurity in our community. It is the first line of defense against hunger for low-income residents. This proposed rule would reduce SNAP benefits by an average of $63.00/month for 450,000 households and will reduce SNAP benefits by 8 percent statewide. For a single parent raising a child, the average food budget for New York State is estimated to be $344.00/month. This rule would eliminate 18 percent of this familys available money for nutritious food. Over 2 million New Yorkers are already food insecure and a large percentage can and should be helped by SNAP. USDA should not reduce the positive impacts of the program when so many people are and can be helped by its benefits.\n \nPolicymakers recognize that household resources needed to pay for basics such as shelter, utility costs and childcare are not available to purchase food.  Under current law, SNAP takes into account the utility expenses of each SNAP household.  States adjust household benefits based on a state-specific Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) calculated by the state and approved by USDA. The current policy allows variances in SUAs to accommodate for differences in utility costs and rates, and allows states flexibility in how they calculate those costs.\n \nThe proposed rule would standardize and cap SUA calculations across the country based on survey data. The proposed rule does not adequately explain USDAs rationale for capping the largest of the SUA components by calibrating to utility expense survey data for those no higher than the 80th percentile of low-income people and then capping other SUA components as well. The proposed rule merely asserts that it calculated calibrating to the 50th percentile compared to the 80th percentile. It does not adequately explain whether USDA analyzed impacts calibrated to the 85th or higher percentiles and what the results of those estimates were.  The lack of such explanation is particularly concerning given research documented that 21 states had SUAs exceeding the 85th percentile estimates, possibly because in their efforts to mitigate benefit loss for households with very high utility costs.\n \nThe Administration concedes that the proposed rule would cause 19 percent of SNAP households to get lower SNAP monthly benefits, would disproportionately impact elderly people and people with disabilities, and would cause a national net cut to SNAP benefits amounting to $4.5 billion over five years.The food security and health implications of the proposed rule are serious and disturbing.  Food insecurity has direct and indirect impacts on physical and mental health for people of all ages. Food insecurity  and even marginal food security (a less severe level of food insecurity) is especially detrimental to the health, development, and well-being of infants, children, and adolescents. Lack of access to food has a lasting and negative impact on peoples lives and livelihood. Children who are food insecure are sick more often, recover from illness more slowly, and are hospitalized more frequently. If we, as a country, are truly focused on the well-being of youth, then we must ensure that no child goes hungry.\n\nThis USDA rulemaking is yet another attempt for the Administration to side step Congress and make cuts to SNAP benefits.  Congress reviewed SNAP policy during the 2018 Farm Bill, including the fact that states have options that may produce differences in SNAP eligibility benefit amounts from state to state.  Although the Presidents FY 2019 Budget included a request for a change similar to the proposed, Congress did not include such a change in the 2018 Farm Bill.  Indeed, evening out benefit amounts across states by lowering benefits for large numbers of participants does not promote SNAPs statutory purpose, but instead undermines its statutory purpose.\n\nFPI strongly opposes the proposed rule that would cut food benefits for struggling people and undermine health in New York State and across our nation.  \n \nSincerely,\n \n \nRon Deutsch, Executive Director\n"},{"name":"090000648416dd4f","clust":82,"clust_order":34,"comp":1,"comp_order":645,"text":"I strongly oppose the Trump Administration's proposal to erode benefits for a food access program that's vital for keeping families from going hungry. \n\nThe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is an integral tool that helps keep low income families, senior citizens, and disabled people from choosing between food and paying for other important costs like medical care.

It would have harmful impacts on health and well-being as well as on the economy. The proposed rule is flawed and should be withdrawn.\n \nSNAPs statutory purpose, as declared by Congress, is to promote the general welfare, to safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation's population by raising levels of nutrition among low-income households. Congress finds that the limited food purchasing power of low-income households contributes to hunger and malnutrition among members of such households. Congress further finds that increased utilization of food in establishing and maintaining adequate national levels of nutrition will promote the distribution in a beneficial manner of the Nation's agricultural abundance and will strengthen the Nation's agricultural economy, as well as result in more orderly marketing and distribution of foods. To alleviate such hunger and malnutrition, a supplemental nutrition assistance program is herein authorized which will permit low-income households to obtain a more nutritious diet through normal channels of trade by increasing food purchasing power for all eligible households who apply for participation. \n\nSNAP plays a critical role in addressing hunger and food insecurity in our community. It is the first line of defense against hunger for low-income residents.\n\n[Insert information about food insecurity in the state and/or city.  Insert information about the positive impacts that SNAP has for health and well-being and for economic activity for local communitiessee, e.g., information contained in http://frac.org/wp-content/uploads/frac-facts-snap-strengths.pdf] \n\nSNAP benefits respond quickly and effectively to changes in need, whether due to economic downturns or natural disasters. According to recent studies, it is estimated that $1 of SNAP benefits leads to between $1.50 and $1.80 in total economic activity during a recession. [See The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Economy:  New Estimates of the SNAP Multiplier, USDA Economic Research Service, July 2019, available at https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/93529/err-265.pdf?v=8010.7 pages 6-8 and Table 1 (regarding research by Blinder and Zandi)]\n\nThe proposed rule would standardize and cap SUA calculations across the country based on survey data. The proposed rule does not adequately explain USDAs rationale for capping the largest of the SUA components by calibrating to utility expense survey data for those no higher than the 80th percentile of low-income people and then capping other SUA components as well.   The proposed rule merely asserts that it calculated calibrating to the 50th percentile compared to the 80th percentile.  The proposed rule does not adequately explain whether USDA analyzed impacts calibrated to the 85th or higher percentiles and what the results of those estimates were.   The lack of such explanation is particularly concerning given research documented that 21 states had SUAs exceeding the 85th percentile estimates, possibly because in their efforts to mitigate benefit loss for households with very high utility costs. \n\nThis USDA rulemaking is yet another attempt for the Administration to side step Congress and make cuts to SNAP benefits.  Congress reviewed SNAP policy during the 2018 Farm Bill, including the fact that states have options that may produce differences in SNAP eligibility benefit amounts from state to state.  Although the Presidents FY 2019 Budget included a request for a change similar to the proposed rule [https://www.obpa.usda.gov/32fns2019notes.pdf], Congress did not include such a change in the 2018 Farm Bill.  Indeed, evening out benefit amounts across states by lowering benefits for large numbers of participants does not promote SNAPs statutory purpose, but instead undermines its statutory purpose.\n\nUSDA should be strengthening the positive impacts of SNAP for health, well-being and economic activity, not making cuts to SNAP benefits.  [I/We] strongly oppose the proposed rule and request the USDA withdraw the rule and work with states to improve their SUAs under existing flexibility.\n\nSincerely,\nRebecca Hasko\n"},{"name":"09000064841c0261","clust":82,"clust_order":42,"comp":1,"comp_order":653,"text":"I submit this comment to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to express opposition to the proposed regulatory changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) that would result in a net loss of $4.5 billion in benefits for households nationwide over the course of five years.

According to the Department's own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years.\n\nThe proposed change to the HCSUA runs counter to SNAP's statutory purpose \"to promote the general welfare, to safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation's population by raising levels of nutrition among low-income households.\"  The proposed rule would exacerbate the struggles many low-income people have paying for costs of both food and utilities.  It would have harmful impacts on health and well-being as well as on the economy. The proposed rule is flawed and should be withdrawn.  \n\nGrowing Home serves low-income families with children in the Denver metro area, providing supportive services to strengthen families, nurture children, and connect community for the past 21 years.  Growing Home's services include a food pantry that is on track to host over 4,300 visits in 2019, an increase of nearly 20% over 2018 and an indicator of how endemic food insecurity is in this community.  The families Growing Home serves are also dealing with rapidly rising housing costs due to development and gentrification of previously affordable neighborhoods, and many families are already stretched to their limits.  Even a modest reduction to SNAP benefits will throw families into crisis as they find themselves even less able to make ends meet.  \n\nGrowing Home's food pantry, like many other area food pantries and food banks, is already operating at capacity due to the aforementioned increase in demand.  If the proposed change to the HCSUA is approved, 40% of SNAP families in Colorado are projected to experience a cut in benefits according to the Regulatory Impact Analysis produced by the United States Department of Agriculture (7 CFR Part 273).  If this happens, Growing Home anticipates a serious spike in demand as families seek supplemental food assistance to replace lost SNAP benefits.  While the proposed rule change is billed as a cost-saving measure, it only serves to shift demand from government programs to nonprofits and social service agencies, as struggling families must turn elsewhere to keep their children fed and warm.  \n\nThis proposed rule change is one of five recent proposals that would negatively impact SNAP recipients presented in recent months, including a proposed work requirement that was initially debated in 2018 and struck from the Farm Bill (the legislation that authorizes and funds SNAP) prior to its passage.  Additional proposed changes impacting SNAP include ending broad-based categorical eligibility that facilitates SNAP enrollment, changes to the Public Charge rule that would penalize potential citizenship applicants for utilizing public benefits, adjusting how the federal poverty level is determined, and this proposed rule change to standardize calculation of the heating and cooling allowance used to calculate benefit levels for SNAP.  Taken together, these proposals represent a coordinated attack on an essential food assistance program and on the millions of families that rely on this assistance to put food on the table.  \n\nA single standard HCSUA is a one-size-fits-all approach that will create harm by nickel and diming families that have neither nickels nor dimes to spare.  SNAP was created to address food insecurity, and this rule change will instead increase it, causing suffering and harm to vulnerable families and depriving children of nutritious food during their crucial formative years.

The standardization of state heating and cooling Standard Utility Allowances (SUAs) is misguided for a number of reasons: (1) it will exacerbate the struggles that many low-income people have paying for the cost of two basic human necessities - food and utilities; (2) it will have harmful effects on the health and well-being of already economically disadvantaged people; (3) it will cause 19 percent of SNAP households, many with children, to get lower SNAP monthly benefits; and (4) it will be especially detrimental in high energy cost states. SNAP's statutory purpose is to promote the general welfare and to safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation's population by raising levels of nutrition among low-income households. This proposed rule undermines this statutory purpose and is an attempt to subvert Congressional intent.\n\nThere already is a recognition that household resources needed to pay for such critical basic needs such as shelter, utility costs and childcare are not available to purchase food. The current policy allows variances in state-specific SUAs to accommodate for differences in costs and rates, and allows the states flexibility in how those costs are calculated. The proposed rule, however, would standardize and cap SUA calculations across the country (which is analogous to an attempt to insert a square peg into a round hole) with a one-size-fits-all approach.

According to the Departments own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years.\n\nThe proposed rule would exacerbate the struggles many low-income people have paying for costs of both food and utilities.  It would have harmful impacts on health and well-being as well as on the economy. The proposed rule is flawed and should be withdrawn.\n \nAs a School Meal Program Director, and reduction in SNAP benefits will have a negative effect on our ability to provide free meals to needy households.\n\nSNAPs statutory purpose, as declared by Congress, is to promote the general welfare, to safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation's population by raising levels of nutrition among low-income households. Congress finds that the limited food purchasing power of low-income households contributes to hunger and malnutrition among members of such households. Congress further finds that increased utilization of food in establishing and maintaining adequate national levels of nutrition will promote the distribution in a beneficial manner of the Nation's agricultural abundance and will strengthen the Nation's agricultural economy, as well as result in more orderly marketing and distribution of foods. To alleviate such hunger and malnutrition, a supplemental nutrition assistance program is herein authorized which will permit low-income households to obtain a more nutritious diet through normal channels of trade by increasing food purchasing power for all eligible households who apply for participation. \n\nSNAP plays a critical role in addressing hunger and food insecurity in our community. It is the first line of defense against hunger for low-income residents.\n\n[Insert information about food insecurity in the state and/or city.  Insert information about the positive impacts that SNAP has for health and well-being and for economic activity for local communitiessee, e.g., information contained in http://frac.org/wp-content/uploads/frac-facts-snap-strengths.pdf] \n\nSNAP benefits respond quickly and effectively to changes in need, whether due to economic downturns or natural disasters. According to recent studies, it is estimated that $1 of SNAP benefits leads to between $1.50 and $1.80 in total economic activity during a recession. [See The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Economy:  New Estimates of the SNAP Multiplier, USDA Economic Research Service, July 2019, available at https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/93529/err-265.pdf?v=8010.7 pages 6-8 and Table 1 (regarding research by Blinder and Zandi)]\nPolicymakers recognize that household resources needed to pay for basics such as shelter, utility costs and childcare are not available to purchase food.  Under current law, SNAP takes into account the utility expenses of each SNAP household.  States adjust household benefits based on a state-specific Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) calculated by the state and approved by USDA. The current policy allows variances in SUAs to accommodate for differences in utility costs and rates, and allows states flexibility in how they calculate those costs. \n\nThe proposed rule would standardize and cap SUA calculations across the country based on survey data. The proposed rule does not adequately explain USDAs rationale for capping the largest of the SUA components by calibrating to utility expense survey data for those no higher than the 80th percentile of low-income people and then capping other SUA components as well.   The proposed rule merely asserts that it calculated calibrating to the 50th percentile compared to the 80th percentile.  The proposed rule does not adequately explain whether USDA analyzed impacts calibrated to the 85th or higher percentiles and what the results of those estimates were.   The lack of such explanation is particularly concerning given research documented that 21 states had SUAs exceeding the 85th percentile estimates, possibly because in their efforts to mitigate benefit loss for households with very high utility costs. \n\nThe Administration concedes that the proposed rule would cause 19 percent of SNAP households to get lower SNAP monthly benefits, would disproportionately impact elderly people and people with disabilities, and would cause a national net cut to SNAP benefits amounting to $4.5 billion over five years.\n\nThis USDA rulemaking is yet another attempt for the Administration to side step Congress and make cuts to SNAP benefits. .  I strongly oppose the proposed rule and request the USDA withdraw the rule and work with states to improve their SUAs under existing flexibility."},{"name":"09000064841db1ea","clust":82,"clust_order":62,"comp":1,"comp_order":673,"text":"As a supporter of the Food Bank For New York City, I strongly oppose this proposed rule that would harm people who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).

Despite the technology-fueled boom of prosperity routinely illustrated by the media, the success of Seattle is not equally shared. The Pollack Food Bank covers some of the wealthiest zip codes in the city, yet each day we are open, we are often overwhelmed by the need of our neighbors. The escalating costs of living in Seattle are obviously most acutely felt by those who are already confronting the challenges of housing and job security due to age, physical limitations or the lack of affordable childcare in this city. Our food bank runs out of food before we ever run out of people in need who wait for hours in our famously miserable weather, many using mobility assistance devices or have small children and infants. I see the very real need for food assistance. It isn't through data tables or spreadsheets; I see it in the faces of people who struggle to meet one of the most fundamental needs of humanity. I see the college student, first in their family to enroll in secondary education, who now chooses between lab fees or lunch. The elderly Russian immigrant who profusely thanks us for every small item they receive. I know these people, I know their names and their children's names - they are Evelyn, whose husband had a stroke while battling cancer, Jade, a young mother of two trying to get her GED, Exiquio, who works in call center, but at minimum wage cannot afford to feed his family, Jolanta, who survived persecution as a Jew in the Soviet Union and has a disabled daughter. These people are not lazy, they are not deadbeats, they are not trying to scam the system. They work hard to survive. They just need a small bit of help to overcome their challenges, challenges which are not unique, not due to an infraction on their part, challenges which could have occurred in anyone's life. When you have access to resources, very few events are insurmountable. Yet far too many people believe that we all have access to the same resources or that in order for us to have access and to succeed, someone else must go without. I cannot even begin to comprehend such beliefs. I cannot begin to comprehend public policy which makes manifest such inequality. I cannot comprehend public policy which denies basic humanity, and which actively discourages the best and most successful outcome for everyone. What possible gain can such policy achieve - there are not words available to explain why we should endeavor to create an exclusionary and inhumane society. \n\nIn Washington State, children and the elderly are the most affected, making up over 50 percent of the people utilizing the emergency food system. . They are not just those experiencing homelessness; they are working poor, households headed by women, families suffering crises such as a layoff, medical emergency or domestic abuse. Local food security agencies have provided the following data:\n 1 in 10 Washingtonians struggle with hunger.\n 1 in 6 Washington kids live in a household that faces challenges in putting enough food on the table.\n 1 in 8 Washingtonians live below the poverty line.\n 1 in 8 Washingtonians relies on SNAP (food stamps), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Half of all people on SNAP are kids.\n The majority of working-age Washingtonians living in poverty are working or actively looking for work. Many work more than one job.\n Washington state ranks 10th in the country in overall wealth - and ranks 34th in food insecurity.\n\nUSDA should be strengthening the positive impacts of SNAP for health, well-being and economic activity, not making cuts to SNAP benefits.

According to the Department's own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years.\n\nThe proposed changes would exacerbate the struggles many low-income people already face in paying for both heat and utilities. This harm will be felt acutely in Vermont, where heating costs are especially high. It would cause serious harm to Vermonters living in our already isolated and rural towns, our community and the nation. The proposed rule will have a lasting and devastating impact on our families and should be withdrawn. \n \nSNAP (known in Vermont as 3SquaresVT) plays a critical role in addressing hunger and food insecurity in Vermont. For over 40 years, SNAP has been our nation's first line of defense against hunger, because it works. It provides, on average, over 70,000 Vermonters and 40 million Americans with money to spend on food in grocery stores and farmers markets each month. It is proven to reduce hunger, lift people out of poverty, and leads to positive short and long-term health, education, and employment outcomes. \n \nPolicymakers recognize that household resources needed to pay for basics such as shelter, utility costs and childcare are not available to purchase food. That is why under current law, SNAP takes into account the utility expenses of each SNAP household. States adjust household benefits based on a state-specific Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) calculated by the state and approved by USDA. The current policy allows variances in SUAs to accommodate for differences in utility costs and rates, and allows states flexibility in how they calculate those costs. This is especially important in a state like Vermont, where heating costs are much higher than in other parts of the country.\nThe proposed rule would standardize and cap SUA calculations across the country based on survey data, but does not contain an adequate explanation of USDA's rationale for the methodology or reasoning behind this strategy or its accuracy. One thing is clear: the proposed rule would cause 19 percent of SNAP households to get lower SNAP monthly benefits, would disproportionately impact elderly people and people with disabilities, and would cause a national net cut to SNAP benefits amounting to $4.5 billion over five years. \nIn Vermont, the impact of this proposal would be even more devastating, and only serve to increase hunger in our state and worsen the benefits cliff for thousands of Vermont families working to put enough food on the table for themselves and their families. According to estimates from Vermont's Department for Children and Families, this proposal would cause 68 percent of Vermont households to lose an average of $82 per month in benefits. This equates to over 26,000 Vermont households, and would mean a loss of over $25 million per year to Vermont's food economy. Additionally, 80 percent of 3SquaresVT households with an older adult or Vermonter with a disability would see a cut in their benefits. This is unacceptable in my community.\nThis USDA rulemaking is yet another attempt for the Administration to side step Congress and make cuts to SNAP benefits. Congress reviewed SNAP policy during the 2018 Farm Bill, including the fact that states have options that may produce differences in SNAP eligibility benefit amounts from state to state. Although the President's FY 2019 Budget included a request for a change similar to the proposed rule [https://www.obpa.usda.gov/32fns2019notes.pdf], Congress did not include such a change in the 2018 Farm Bill. Indeed, evening out benefit amounts across states by lowering benefits for large numbers of participants does not promote SNAP's statutory purpose, but rather directly undermines and seeks to weaken it.\nUSDA should be strengthening the positive impacts of SNAP for health, well-being and economic activity, not making cuts to SNAP benefits. Little Rivers Health Care strongly oppose the proposed rule and request the USDA withdraw the rule and work with states to improve their SUA's under existing flexibility.\n\nThe real issue is that millions of Americans and thousands of Vermonters are struggling to make ends meet and aren't able to access enough food to grow, learn, and stay healthy. Instead of proposing severe cuts to programs like SNAP, the Trump administration should be working to increase wages and improve access to housing, health care, and food assistance.\n\nWe strongly oppose the proposed rule that would cut food benefits for struggling people and harm our community. Instead, We request that USDA withdraw this rule and work with states to improve their SUA's under existing flexibility.\n"},{"name":"09000064841c04f5","clust":82,"clust_order":103,"comp":1,"comp_order":714,"text":"USDA Food and Nutrition Service notation for rulemaking docket FNS-2019-0009.

Choosing to remove $26 million per year from the local food economy would have devastating effects on all of these families and businesses. \nSNAP (known in Vermont as 3SquaresVT) plays a critical role in addressing hunger and food insecurity in Vermont. For over 40 years, SNAP has been our nations first line of defense against hunger, because it works. It provides, on average, over 70,000 Vermonters and 40 million Americans with money to spend on food in grocery stores and farmers markets each month. It is proven to reduce hunger, lift people out of poverty, and leads to positive short and long-term health, education, and employment outcomes.\nA significant number of families in our community rely on this program to keep food on their table. The proposed cuts would remove an average of $82 per month in benefits for 68% of 3SquaresVt households. Thats over 3 in 5 households that would no longer have the means to provide adequate nourishment to meet daily needs. This proposed rule would cut 3SquaresVT benefits for 80% of households with an older Vermonter or a person with a disability. These are members of our community that are unable to be a productive part of the workforce and thus rely on these programs for survival. These individuals should not have to choose between buying the medications they need and putting food on the table. They should not have to choose between heating their home and putting food on the table. The proposed cuts to the 3SquaresVT program would make this decision a daily reality for these families. \nThe proposed rule would standardize and cap SUA calculations across the country based on survey data but does not contain an adequate explanation of USDAs rationale for the methodology or reasoning behind this strategy or its accuracy. One thing is clear: the proposed rule would cause 19 percent of SNAP households to get lower SNAP monthly benefits, would disproportionately impact elderly people and people with disabilities and would cause a national net cut to SNAP benefits amounting to $4.5 billion over five years.\nIn Vermont, the impact of this proposal would be even more devastating and only serve to increase hunger in our state and worsen the benefits cliff for thousands of Vermont families working to put enough food on the table for themselves and their families. This is unacceptable in our community.\nUSDA should be strengthening the positive impacts of SNAP for health, well-being and economic activity, not making cuts to SNAP benefits. We strongly oppose the proposed rule and request the USDA withdraw the rule and work with states to improve their SUAs under existing flexibility.\n"},{"name":"090000648411d8f0","clust":82,"clust_order":105,"comp":1,"comp_order":716,"text":"Do not have the USDA's proposed rule on SNAP Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances  go through.

It is the first line of defense against hunger for low-income residents.  SNAP benefits respond quickly and effectively to changes in need, whether due to economic downturns, personal life events, or natural disasters.\n\nAccording to recent studies, it is estimated that $1 of SNAP benefits leads to between $1.50 and $1.80 in total economic activity during a recession. [See The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Economy:  New Estimates of the SNAP Multiplier, USDA Economic Research Service, July 2019, available at https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/93529/err-265.pdf?v=8010.7 pages 6-8 and Table 1 (regarding research by Blinder and Zandi)]\n\nPolicymakers recognize that household resources needed to pay for basics such as shelter, utility costs and childcare are not available to purchase food.  Under current law, SNAP takes into account the utility expenses of each SNAP household.  States adjust household benefits based on a state-specific Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) calculated by the state and approved by USDA. The current policy allows variances in SUAs to accommodate for differences in utility costs and rates, and allows states flexibility in how they calculate those costs. \n\nThe proposed rule would standardize and cap SUA calculations across the country based on survey data. The proposed rule does not adequately explain USDAs rationale for doing this.   The proposed rule merely asserts that it calculated calibrating to the 50th percentile compared to the 80th percentile. Further explanation and justification is necessary, given research that documented that 21 states had SUAs exceeding the 85th percentile estimates, presumably in their efforts to mitigate benefit loss for households with very high utility costs.\nConnecticut is a state with higher than average utility costs, and therefore Connecticut residents would be disadvantaged by a rule that requires the state to use a nationwide average utility cost when calculating household resources that are available to buy food.\n\nThe Administration concedes that the proposed rule would cause 19 percent of SNAP households to get lower SNAP monthly benefits, would disproportionately impact elderly people and people with disabilities, and would cause a national net cut to SNAP benefits amounting to $4.5 billion over five years.\n\nThis USDA rule-making is yet another attempt for the Administration to sidestep Congress and make cuts to SNAP benefits.  Congress reviewed SNAP policy during the 2018 Farm Bill, including the fact that states have options that may produce differences in SNAP eligibility benefit amounts from state to state.  Although the Presidents FY 2019 Budget included a request for a change similar to the proposed rule [https://www.obpa.usda.gov/32fns2019notes.pdf], Congress chose not to include such a change in the 2018 Farm Bill.  \n\nEvening out benefit amounts across states by lowering benefits for large numbers of participants does not promote SNAPs statutory purpose, but instead undermines its statutory purpose.\n\nUSDA should be strengthening the positive impacts of SNAP on health, well-being and economic activity, not making cuts to SNAP benefits.

According to the Department's own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years.\n\nThe proposed changes would exacerbate the struggles many low-income people already face in paying for both heat and utilities. This harm would be felt acutely in Vermont, where heating costs are especially high. It would cause serious harm to Vermonters  our community and the nation. The proposed rule is flaws and should be withdrawn.\n \nSNAP (known in Vermont as 3SquaresVT) plays a critical role in addressing hunger and food insecurity in Vermont. For over 40 years, SNAP has been our nation's first line of defense against hunger, because it works. It provides, on average, over 70,000 Vermonters and 40 million Americans with money to spend on food in grocery stores and farmers markets each month. It is proven to reduce hunger, lift people out of poverty, and leads to positive short and long-term health, education, and employment outcomes. \n \nPolicymakers recognize that household resources needed to pay for basics such as shelter, utility costs and childcare are not available to purchase food. That is why under current law, SNAP takes into account the utility expenses of each SNAP household. States adjust household benefits based on a state-specific Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) calculated by the state and approved by USDA. The current policy allows variances in SUAs to accommodate for differences in utility costs and rates, and allows states flexibility in how they calculate those costs. This is especially important in a state like Vermont, where heating costs are much higher than in other parts of the country.\nThe proposed rule would standardize and cap SUA calculations across the country based on survey data, but does not contain an adequate explanation of USDA's rationale for the methodology or reasoning behind this strategy or its accuracy. One thing is clear: the proposed rule would cause 19 percent of SNAP households to get lower SNAP monthly benefits, would disproportionately impact elderly people and people with disabilities, and would cause a national net cut to SNAP benefits amounting to $4.5 billion over five years. \nIn Vermont, the impact of this proposal would be even more devastating, and only serve to increase hunger in our state and worsen the benefits cliff for thousands of Vermont families working to put enough food on the table for themselves and their families. According to estimates from Vermont's Department for Children and Families, this proposal would cause 68 percent of Vermont households to lose an average of $82 per month in benefits. This equates to over 26,000 Vermont households, and would mean a loss of over $25 million per year to Vermont's food economy. Additionally, 80 percent of 3SquaresVT households with an older adult or Vermonter with a disability would see a cut in their benefits. This is unacceptable in my community.\n\n I strongly oppose the proposed rule that would cut food benefits for struggling people and harm our community. Instead. I request that USDA withdraw this rule and work with states to improve their SUA's under existing flexibility.\n \nSincerely,\n\nPat Mainer\n"},{"name":"090000648414f217","clust":7,"clust_order":2,"comp":7,"comp_order":2,"text":"November 13, 2019\n \nSNAP Program Design Branch,\nProgram Development Division\nFood and Nutrition Service\n3101 Park Center Drive\nU.S. Department of Agriculture\nAlexandria, VA 22302\n \nRe:  Notice of Proposed Rule Making Regarding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances -- RIN 0584-AE69\n \nDear SNAP Program Design Branch:\n \nThank you for the opportunity to comment on USDAs Notice of Proposed Rule regarding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances.

It helps Vermonters afford enough food for themselves and their families, pulls people out of poverty, helps people learn and find and keep jobs, and improves health, both in the short term and in the long term. At Mercy Connections, we run the Vermont Womens Mentoring Program which matches volunteer women mentors to incarcerated women mentees in re-entry to community. Virtually every mentee is struggling to find work or training for work, affordable housing and food to establish their basic needs and not return to jail. They would be extremely hard-hit by this proposed cut to their 3Squares VT assistance and at greater risk of recidivism as a result.\n\nAccording to estimates from Vermonts Department for Children and Families (the agency that administers 3SquaresVT), this rule would mean that 26,000 Vermont households would receive a cut in their 3SquaresVT benefits, on average losing $82 per month for food; thats over 3 in 5 3SquaresVT households. It would harm older Vermonters and people with disabilities at an even higher rate; 80 percent of these households would receive a cut. Additionally, with nearly $26 million fewer dollars per year coming into our state to help people in need buy more and better food, our local retailers and state economy would be harmed. This is unacceptable in my community. Most mentees in the VT Womens Mentoring Program are also young, unmarried mothers. These proposed cuts could be absolutely devastating to the health of their young children, most of whom they are struggling to keep and with whom they seek to establish a nurturing, healthy relationship.\n\nIn a rural and cold-weather state like Vermont, people who struggle to make ends meet have a lot of obstacles to overcome. Especially at this time of year, it is cruel and misguided to attempt to weaken a program that is proven to help people buy more and better food. Please dont make accessing food even harder for the thousands of Vermonters and millions of Americans working hard to stay healthy while covering their bills and keeping the heat on. Instead of proposing to cut 3SquaresVT, I urge you to work to increase wages and improve access to housing, healthcare, and food assistance programs like 3SquaresVT.

For over 40 years, SNAP has been our nation's first line of defense against hunger, because it works. It provides, on average, over 70,000 Vermonters and 40 million Americans with money to spend on food in grocery stores and farmers markets each month. It is proven to reduce hunger, lift people out of poverty, and leads to positive short and long-term health, education, and employment outcomes. \n\n\tThe proposed rule, reducing access to SNAP, is flawed and should be withdrawn.\n \nThe proposed changes would exacerbate the struggles many low-income people already face in paying for housing, heat, and utilities. According to the Department's own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years. This harm would be felt acutely in Vermont, where heating and food costs are especially high. It would cause serious harm to the Vermonters we serve in Lamoille, Washington, Orange & Northern Windsor counties where, according to data from 2016, 12,052 of our community members live below the Federal Poverty Level.  The proposal would be most problematic for our youngest and most vulnerable Vermonters, our children. According to the American Community Survey 5-year data, an average of 20.3% of the children in our community live below the federal poverty level.  \n\nCapstone Community Action helps stabilize families in economic crisis by working to meet their basic needs for food, shelter and heat.  We help them access tools to rise beyond poverty through a wide array of services, including: weatherization services to reduce and control future utility costs in their homes; financial empowerment initiatives to help them establish credit, build assets, start businesses, and understand how to make their money work for them; by providing education and training for future employment options; Head Start & Early Head Start programming, giving children a strong foundation so they can succeed in school and in life. \n \nYet, in order for our community to succeed, our people need to be able to access sufficient healthy foods.  The proposed rule would standardize and cap SUA calculations across the country based on survey data, but does not contain an adequate explanation of USDA's rationale for the methodology or reasoning behind this strategy or its accuracy. One thing is clear: the proposed rule would cause 19 percent of SNAP households to get lower SNAP monthly benefits, would disproportionately impact elderly people and people with disabilities, and would cause a national net cut to SNAP benefits amounting to $4.5 billion over five years. \n\nIn Vermont, the impact of this proposal would be even more devastating, causing 68 % of Vermont households to lose an average of $82 per month in benefits. This equates to over 26,000 Vermont households, and would mean a loss of over $25 million per year to Vermont's food economy. Additionally, 80 % of SNAP households with an older adult or Vermonter with a disability would see a cut in their benefits. This is unacceptable for our community.\n\nTake the example of Jeana, a single mother with a disabled son. \"Without my 3Squares benefits I would struggle. Without free lunch at school, he wouldn't have lunch at school.  Because of the SNAP benefits I am able to keep a roof over our heads.

Pittsburgh has a large food insecure population and a many of the residents live in food desserts. In Allegheny County alone, one in seven people experience food insecurity, 21.4% or 1 in 5 Pittsburgh residents are food insecure. There is growing acknowledgement in the health care community that health outcomes and disparities are more often driven by social determinants of health than by medical care. Food insecurity -- a primary social determinant -- is associated with some of the most serious and costly chronic health problems in the nation: hypertension, CHD, hepatitis, stroke, cancer, asthma, diabetes, arthritis, COPD, and kidney disease. One out of three chronically ill adults is unable to afford medicine, food, or both. The implications for national health care costs are staggering and resulted in direct and indirect health-related costs estimated to be $160 billion in 2014 alone.\n\nThe Healthy Food Center strives improve health and overall well-being by providing access to healthy nutritious food choices, nutrition education, and support to the food insecure population in a healthcare setting. The Healthy Food Center is program under the Center for Inclusion Health serving the socially marginalized and underserved populations, such as the food insecure population. At no cost, we provide nutritious food choices, disease based education, and assistance with wrap around services, such as SNAP applications. We collaborate significantly with community partners to help lift our efforts, such as, the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank for our healthy inventory, Gateway Health for kitchen utensils, The Food Trust for fresh produce coupons, and Traveler's Aid for transportation services. We solely identify our clients through screening questions with no income requirements. We help to bridge the meal gap between federal assistance guidelines and individuals who may not meet the requirements.

It would have harmful impacts on health and well-being, as well as on the economy as a whole. The proposed rule is flawed and should be withdrawn.\n \nSNAPs statutory purpose, as declared by Congress, is to promote the general welfare, to safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation's population by raising levels of nutrition among low-income households. Congress finds that the limited food purchasing power of low-income households contributes to hunger and malnutrition among members of such households. Congress further finds that increased utilization of food in establishing and maintaining adequate national levels of nutrition will promote the distribution in a beneficial manner of the Nation's agricultural abundance and will strengthen the Nation's agricultural economy, as well as result in more orderly marketing and distribution of foods. To alleviate such hunger and malnutrition, a supplemental nutrition assistance program is herein authorized which will permit low-income households to obtain a more nutritious diet through normal channels of trade by increasing food purchasing power for all eligible households who apply for participation. \n\nI have worked in several positions where Ive witnessed firsthand the critical role that SNAP plays in addressing hunger and food insecurity, specifically in Massachusetts and in North Carolina. This includes time with the Asheville-Buncombe Food Policy Council where I worked to increase the utilization of SNAP at farmers markets, a job in the front office of a public school, where I worked closely with families receiving SNAP benefits, and in my current position at the Greater Boston Food Bank. While it is consistent that low-income people will be faced with making the choice between shelter, utilities, medical costs, childcare, and food, these costs are certainly not consistent across the two states I have lived and worked in. \n\nCurrently, the utility expenses of each SNAP household are taken into account and states adjust benefits based on a state-specific Standard Utility Allowance (SUA). The current policy allows variances in SUAs to accommodate for differences in utility costs and rates, and allows states flexibility in how costs are calculated. It is commonly known that Massachusetts has some of the highest housing, food and childcare costs in the United States. While individuals and families in both states will need to navigate these costs with limited resources, the SUA for someone living in North Carolina will not be equivalent to that of someone living in Massachusetts.  \n\nStandardizing benefit amounts across the country by lowering benefits for many does not promote SNAPs statutory purpose as quoted above. Older adults and people with disabilities will be disparately impacted by the proposed rule, and the purchasing power of SNAP households will decrease. \n\nFinally, the proposed rule does not adequately explain USDAs rationale for capping the largest of the SUA components by calibrating to utility expense survey data for those no higher than the 80th percentile of low-income people. The proposed rule does not adequately explain whether USDA analyzed impacts calibrated to the 85th or higher percentiles and what the results of those estimates were.  The lack of such explanation is particularly concerning given research documented that 21 states had SUAs exceeding the 85th percentile estimates. \n\nUSDA should be strengthening the positive impacts of SNAP for health, well-being and economic activity, not making cuts to the program.

In many cases, struggling Americans are faced with the daunting choice of paying their utility bill or buying food.  This is why the current law allows states to factor in utility expenses when calculating SNAP benefit levels.  Each state is currently permitted to adjust household benefits based upon a state-specific Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) which must be approved by USDA.  This policy allows for variances in SUAs to account for factors, such as differences in utility costs and rates, which tend to vary greatly throughout the nation.  However, this proposed rule would utilize survey data to standardize and cap SUA calculations.   \n\nThis new methodology is flawed and hurts low-income Americans in many ways.  First, this proposed rule does not adequately explain USDA's rationale for capping the largest of the SUA components by calibrating to utility expense survey data for those no higher than the 80th percentile of low-income people.  The proposed rule merely asserts that it calculated calibrating to the 50th percentile compared to the 80th percentile.  Furthermore, the rule does not adequately address whether USDA analyzed the true impact these new calibrations would have upon low income households struggling to get by in America.  This lack of documented clarity is particularly concerning given that there are currently 21 states with SUAs already exceeding the 85th percentile in an attempt to mitigate benefit loss for households in states, like New York, with very high utility costs.  The Trump Administration and USDA acknowledge that this rule would cause 19 percent of SNAP households to receive lower monthly benefits, disproportionately impact the elderly and people with disabilities, and cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over the five years.  This shortsighted rule has the potential to negatively impact 144,000 Long Islanders relying upon SNAP benefits to put food on the table for themselves and their families.  Many of these people are also accessing the services of their regional food bank, Long Island Cares, Inc., and we fear that an increase of this magnitude would place an undue burden on the nation's food banks, who without increased federal support would not have the resources to step in and fill these new gaps.   \n\nThis new USDA rulemaking is another attempt by the Administration to sidestep Congress and make severe SNAP cuts.  During the 2018 Farm Bill negotiations, Congress reviewed SNAP policy, including the provisions relating to states having the option to produce differences in SNAP eligibility based upon the differences in regional cost of living expenses.  Last year, the President's FY 2019 Budget included a request very similar to this proposed rulemaking, but Congress decided not to enact such a change in the final version of the 2018 Farm Bill.  \n\nLong Island Cares is proud to stand with hunger advocates such as Feeding America and the Food Research and Action Center (FRAC) in encouraging USDA to take steps to strengthen SNAP, and to cease circumventing Congress in repeated attempts to restructure the program in ways that produce dramatic benefit cuts.  Long Island Cares, Inc.The Harry Chapin Food Bank is proud to go on record in staunch opposition to this proposed rule, and we respectfully request that USDA immediately withdraws this rule and instead seeks input from the states on how to best improve their current SUAs under the flexibility provided by the current rules.  \n\nRespectfully Submitted by,\n\nMichael W.

I work with the elderly and their families. I see many people trying to live on less than $1000 per month per person in income...here in Vermont...that doesn't work when you have property taxes, fuel, homeowners ins., and utilities. This didn't even take a vehicle into consideration, which we all need in rural Vermont. Now the little bit of breath they could take was knowing they qualified for $194/month in food assistance...try eating yourself for less than that...you can't do that and maintain lower blood sugars, low cholesterol, and or low blood pressures. These people raised our communities and didn't have programs just sitting out there to be used, they worked hard for everything. Many of them are still struggling with part-time jobs just to make ends meet. If any group in our small little state needs a break it's our elderly.  \n\nAccording to estimates from Vermont's Department for Children and Families (the agency that administers 3SquaresVT), this rule would mean that 26,000 Vermont households would receive a cut in their 3SquaresVT benefits, on average losing $82 per month for food; that's over 3 in 5 3SquaresVT households. It would harm older Vermonters and people with disabilities at an even higher rate; 80 percent of these households would receive a cut. Additionally, with nearly $26 million fewer dollars per year coming into our state to help people in need buy more and better food, our local retailers and state economy would be harmed. This is unacceptable in my community. $82 per month may not sound like much to you; but to an older person that is how this breaks down as to what they now cannot afford:\n$16/month 4 gallons of milk at $3.99/gal (one gallon per 7 day week)\n$19/month 4 lb of hamburger at $4.75/lb 91%lean (one pound of burger per 7 day week)\n$14/month 4 lbs of chicken breast at $3.50/lb boneless (one pound of chicken per 7 day week)\n$8/month 4 loafs of bread at $2/loaf (one loaf of bread over a 7 day week)\n$25 fruits and vegetables do we need to take these out of their mouths too??? Our seniors should not worry if they can afford fresh fruits, meats, and dairy. Our seniors have the largest health concerns around diets.

According to the Department's own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years.\n\nThe proposed rule would exacerbate the struggles many low-income people have paying for costs of both food and utilities.  It would have harmful impacts on health and well-being as well as on the economy. The proposed rule is flawed and should be withdrawn.\n\nThe Upper Valley Haven, where I am the Executive Director, is keenly aware of the challenges of food insecurity experienced by people who have low incomes. We provide the second largest food shelf in the state of Vermont serving over 12,000 of friends and neighbors in this community. \n\nHunger is a problem in Vermont. Over 59 thousand Vermonters live in food insecure households, meaning they don't have regular access to nutritious food. This is 10% of the total population. Seventeen thousand Vermont children (15%) under the age of 18 live in food insecure households (15%) Food insecurity also disproportionately affects seniors.\n\nSNAP plays a critical role in addressing hunger and food insecurity in our community. It is the first line of defense against hunger for low-income residents. \n\nThe proposed rule change in how states take households' utility costs into consideration when determining the amount of benefits households receive will have devastating effects.\n\nIf enacted, this rule would:\n\n Cut an average of $82 per month in benefits for 68% of 3SquaresVT households.\n Cut 3SquaresVT benefits for 80% of households with an older Vermonter or person with a disability.\n Remove nearly $26 million per year from Vermont's food economy. This new proposal would hurt Vermont more than any other state\n\nThe Administration concedes that the proposed rule would cause 19 percent of SNAP households to get lower SNAP monthly benefits, would disproportionately impact elderly people and people with disabilities, and would cause a national net cut to SNAP benefits amounting to $4.5 billion over five years.\n\nThe food security and health implications of the proposed rule are serious and disturbing.  Food insecurity has direct and indirect impacts on physical and mental health for people of all ages. Food insecurity  and even marginal food security (a less severe level of food insecurity) is especially detrimental to the health, development, and well-being of infants, children, and adolescents. \nSNAP plays a critical role in improving the food security, health, and well-being of program participants across the lifespan.\nOlder adults and people with disabilities will be disparately impacted by the proposed rule.  SNAP plays an important role in supporting the food security, nutrition, and health of older adults, allowing them to maintain their independence while also reducing their health care utilization and costs.  People with disabilities are at higher risk of food insecurity, making SNAP a critical support for this vulnerable population as well.\nThis USDA rulemaking is yet another attempt for the Administration to side step Congress and make cuts to SNAP benefits.  Congress reviewed SNAP policy during the 2018 Farm Bill, including the fact that states have options that may produce differences in SNAP eligibility benefit amounts from state to state.  Although the President's FY 2019 Budget included a request for a change similar to the proposed rule. Congress did not include such a change in the 2018 Farm Bill.  Indeed, evening out benefit amounts across states by lowering benefits for large numbers of participants does not promote SNAP's statutory purpose, but instead undermines its statutory purpose.\nI strongly oppose the proposed rule that would cut food benefits for struggling people and undermine health in our community and across our nation.  \n\nSincerely,\n \n\nMichael Redmond\nExecutive Director\n"},{"name":"09000064841a7538","clust":7,"clust_order":12,"comp":7,"comp_order":12,"text":"\n 11/23/2019\n\nSNAP Program Design Branch,\nProgram Development Division\nFood and Nutrition Service\n3101 Park Center Drive\nU.S. Department of Agriculture\nAlexandria, VA 22302\n \nRe:  Notice of Proposed Rule Making Regarding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances -- RIN 0584-AE69\n \nDear SNAP Program Design Branch:\n \nThank you for the opportunity to comment on USDA's Notice of Proposed Rule regarding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances. According to the Department's own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years. I want to voice my strong opposition to this proposal; if it goes into effect, this will cause serious harm to Vermonters in my community, as well as people across the country. The proposed rule should be withdrawn.\n\n3SquaresVT (our state's name for SNAP) is Vermont's first line of defense against hunger. It helps Vermonters afford enough food for themselves and their families, pulls people out of poverty, helps people learn and find and keep jobs, and improves health, both in the short term and in the long term. I moved to Vermont to attend graduate school. As a single mother and graduate student, I was able to work only 12-15 hours per week, and was paid a non-livable wage for that time. Without the 3SquaresVT program., I do not know how I would have made it through school. Once I graduated, I was unable to find a job for over a year. Again, 3SquaresVT helped my family make it through this difficult time. I would like to emphasize that I am not an exception. I know more single mothers than I care to count, who are (amazingly) juggling school, work, and raising children.\n\nAccording to estimates from Vermont's Department for Children and Families (the agency that administers 3SquaresVT), this rule would mean that 26,000 Vermont households would receive a cut in their 3SquaresVT benefits, on average losing $82 per month for food; that's over 3 in 5 3SquaresVT households. It would harm older Vermonters and people with disabilities at an even higher rate; 80 percent of these households would receive a cut. Additionally, with nearly $26 million fewer dollars per year coming into our state to help people in need buy more and better food, our local retailers and state economy would be harmed. This is unacceptable in my community. The struggles I share with my fellow single mothers highlight a lack of jobs that pay a livable wage as well as the need for a societal safety net that not only ensures our most vulnerable citizens get what they need, but that also supports people through the unexpected life changes many of us experience. Without the bare minimum support of comprehensive food assistance for those in need, the message we receive is that our lives do not count as much as people who are not in need of support. And that somehow this is our fault and should be treated punitively, rather than addressing the systemic ills that reinforce poverty and heighten the wealth gap (i.e. minimum wage, child care, education costs).\n\nIn a rural and cold-weather state like Vermont, people who struggle to make ends meet have a lot of obstacles to overcome.

According to the Department's own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years. The goal of SNAP is to prevent people from going hungry. These changes would go against the stated goal of the program. \n\nWe are a congregation of Catholic Sisters whose mission is to promote justice in all areas of society and our church. For over 170 years we have been faithful to that mission through our ministries in education and social service. The foundation of Catholic Social Teachings is the complete acceptance in the dignity of the human person. We believe every person deserves to be treated with dignity, which includes that every person, not matter status in our country, requires that he/she be given the necessities of life...food, clothing, and shelter.  \n\nWe have been ministering with people who are poor and vulnerable. We have ministered at food shelters and soup kitchens. We have seen the effects on children in schools who do not have enough to eat. We know the pressure parents experience trying to figure out how to feed their family for the month. SNAP has alleviated some of that pressure. However, these changes will up the pressure on families as they will have to choose between paying for housing and paying for food. \n\nAccording to Feeding Wisconsin the Wisconsin Assembly District 49 in which our motherhouse is located the percentage of food insecurity is 10%, the poverty rate is 5% and the unemployment rate is 14%. The changes will affect the people in our area.\n\nAccording to one report, the Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue defended the changes by saying that it would help the American taxpayer. His defense is unconscionable! Is it acceptable in this country to cause people to go hungry in order to help those who have money? Our values and beliefs say NO! \n\nPart of the purpose of the change is to encourage people to work, however those in danger of losing access to SNAP might be discouraged from working because the new calculation would put them in a higher income bracket, causing them to lose access. \n\nSNAP lifted 3.2 million Americans out of poverty in 2018, according to the Census Bureau's Supplemental Poverty Measure. SNAP is nearly as effective as the Earned Income Tax Credit in lifting families above the poverty line, and far more effective than any other program in lifting families out of deep poverty. \n\nUSDA should be strengthening the positive impacts of SNAP for health, well-being and economic activity, not making cuts to SNAP benefits.  [I/We] strongly oppose the proposed rule and request the USDA withdraw the rule and work with states to improve their SUA's under existing flexibility.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSr. Regina McKillip, OP\nPromoter of Peace and Justice\nDominicans of Sinsinawa\n\n\n\n"},{"name":"090000648413093d","clust":7,"clust_order":14,"comp":7,"comp_order":14,"text":"November 7, 2019\n\nSNAP Program Design Branch,\nProgram Development Division\nFood and Nutrition Service\n3101 Park Center Drive\nU.S. Department of Agriculture\nAlexandria, VA 22302\n \nRe:  Notice of Proposed Rule Making Regarding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances -- RIN 0584-AE69\n \nDear SNAP Program Design Branch:\n \nOn behalf of the Brattleboro Food Co-op we appreciate the opportunity to comment on USDAs Notice of Proposed Rule regarding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances.

This harm would be felt acutely in Vermont, where heating costs are especially high. It would cause serious harm to Vermonters, our community and the nation. The proposed rule is flaws and should be withdrawn.\n\nSNAP (known in Vermont as 3SquaresVT) plays a critical role in addressing hunger and food insecurity in Vermont. For over 40 years, SNAP has been our nations first line of defense against hunger, because it works. It provides, on average, over 70,000 Vermonters and 40 million Americans with money to spend on food in grocery stores and farmers markets each month. It is proven to reduce hunger, lift people out of poverty, and leads to positive short and long-term health, education, and employment outcomes. \n \n3SVT allows people of lower income to shop for higher quality foods and prepare meals that support a healthy lifestyle. \nPolicymakers recognize that household resources needed to pay for basics such as shelter, utility costs and childcare are not available to purchase food. That is why under current law, SNAP takes into account the utility expenses of each SNAP household. States adjust household benefits based on a state-specific Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) calculated by the state and approved by USDA. The current policy allows variances in SUAs to accommodate for differences in utility costs and rates, and allows states flexibility in how they calculate those costs. This is especially important in a state like Vermont, where heating costs are much higher than in other parts of the country.\nThe proposed rule would standardize and cap SUA calculations across the country based on survey data, but does not contain an adequate explanation of USDAs rationale for the methodology or reasoning behind this strategy or its accuracy. One thing is clear: the proposed rule would cause 19 percent of SNAP households to get lower SNAP monthly benefits, would disproportionately impact elderly people and people with disabilities, and would cause a national net cut to SNAP benefits amounting to $4.5 billion over five years. \nIn Vermont, the impact of this proposal would be even more devastating, and only serve to increase hunger in our state and worsen the benefits cliff for thousands of Vermont families working to put enough food on the table for themselves and their families. According to estimates from Vermonts Department for Children and Families, this proposal would cause 68 percent of Vermont households to lose an average of $82 per month in benefits. This equates to over 26,000 Vermont households, and would mean a loss of over $25 million per year to Vermonts food economy. Additionally, 80 percent of 3SquaresVT households with an older adult or Vermonter with a disability would see a cut in their benefits. This is unacceptable in my community.\nUSDA should be strengthening the positive impacts of SNAP for health, well-being and economic activity, not making cuts to SNAP benefits.  We strongly oppose the proposed rule and request the USDA withdraw the rule and work with states to improve their SUAs under existing flexibility.\n\nThe real issue is that millions of Americans and thousands of Vermonters are struggling to make ends meet and arent able to access enough food to grow, learn, and stay healthy.

I live in the city of Tacoma just south of Seattle in the state of Washington and I know what it's like to be hurt by assumptions.  Life was a lot different for me just a few years ago and by different, I mean there wasn't much light or hope.  As I hit that \"rock bottom\" point in my life, which is defined differently for everyone, I began humbling myself and asking for help because I knew I couldn't change my life on my own.  I connected with people with similar experiences, but who were living a life that was much brighter and full of hope.  I am forever grateful to the case workers, mentors, and volunteers who directed me towards helpful resources including SNAP.

Years later, I write to you now as a contributing member of my community and as an advocate for food justice and anti-poverty.\n\nWhat the administration fails to continuously do is center the Americans these proposed changes will affect.  It is another way for the current administration to impose a \"pick yourself up by your boot straps\" change that again, assumes everyone starts at the same place in life.\n\nBecause of SNAP, and the ability for states to decide on who and how benefits are distributed, the program can \"promote the general welfare, to safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation's population by raising levels of nutrition among low-income households.

According to the Department's own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years.\n\nThe proposed rule would further exacerbate the struggles many low-income people have paying for costs of both food and utilities.  In Ohio, we estimate that 40% of all SNAP households with children would lose benefits under this proposed SUA rule. A recent study of Ohioans using food pantries in Ohio, found that 70% of respondents reported they had to choose between food and utilities. Meaning 7 in 10 households are already facing a heat or eat crisis. It is further estimated that this propose rule, if it went into effect would directly impact over 300,000 SNAP households who would see their SNAP benefits reduced by an average of $40.00 per month. This proposed rule will increase hunger for Ohioans already struggling to put food on their tables and will have harmful impacts on their health and well-being as well as on the economy. The proposed rule is flawed and should be withdrawn.\n\nThe Ohio Association of Foodbanks is Ohio's largest charitable response to hunger.  Our network is made up of 12 Feeding America foodbanks and 3,601-member food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters, and supplemental feeding programs, serving all of Ohio's 88 counties. Together, our network distributed 229,546,132 pounds of food, or about 191.3 million meals, serving Ohio families 3,438,315 times in 2019. Some of these households came to a food pantry just once for help in an emergency. Others came a handful of times when paychecks came up short. Still others rely on our network regularly for help because their limited fixed incomes and SNAP/food stamp benefits aren't enough to meet their basic needs for food. We strive to be there when our hungry friends and neighbors need us.\n\nSNAP is the first line of defense against hunger in our state and nation, not foodbanks. SNAP provides 12 meals to every 1 meal my network provides. \n\nThe impact of this proposed rule would be devastating to Ohio. Ohio would lose over $150 million per year in SNAP benefits, resulting in a nearly $250 million loss in annual economic activity.\n\no\tNearly 1.7 million Ohioans (14.5% of the population) are food insecure and 83% live below the Federal poverty line. The average SNAP household lives on just $829 per month, with SNAP providing an additional $126 per month in nutrition assistance. FNS does not appear to consider how the proposed rule would negatively impact the fundamental goal of the Food and Nutrition Act to \"provide for improved levels of nutrition among low-income households.\" \n\no\t71% of SNAP households in Ohio have documented shelter expenses, averaging $778 per month. Even so, the average shelter deduction in Ohio is just $429 due to the federal cap on shelter deductions for most households. Those most likely to see their SNAP benefits cut because of this proposal are households with elderly and/or disabled members, since their shelter deduction is not artificially capped. \n\nThe proposed rule would hurt Ohio's economy, especially retail grocery stores and the jobs they provide in our communities.\no\tSNAP is an important source of food purchasing power for struggling families and often keeps critical grocery stores in low-income neighborhoods afloat.

According to the Departments own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years.\n\nThe proposed rule would exacerbate the struggles many low-income people have paying for costs of both food and utilities. This will harm the rural poor, the urban poor, and families across the US.  It would have harmful impacts on health and well-being as well as on the economy. The proposed rule is flawed and should be withdrawn.\n\nI work with the rural poor in southern Delaware and many families depend on these resources to survive. In particular, this is important when heating and cooling demands are high. I have had patients stop medication to afford air conditioning or cut their heat to afford medication. This is unacceptable to put lives at risk to cut your budget. These benefits need to be expanded for these families.\n \nSNAPs statutory purpose, as declared by Congress, is to promote the general welfare, to safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation's population by raising levels of nutrition among low-income households. Congress finds that the limited food purchasing power of low-income households contributes to hunger and malnutrition among members of such households. Congress further finds that increased utilization of food in establishing and maintaining adequate national levels of nutrition will promote the distribution in a beneficial manner of the Nation's agricultural abundance and will strengthen the Nation's agricultural economy, as well as result in more orderly marketing and distribution of foods. To alleviate such hunger and malnutrition, a supplemental nutrition assistance program is herein authorized which will permit low-income households to obtain a more nutritious diet through normal channels of trade by increasing food purchasing power for all eligible households who apply for participation. \n\nSNAP plays a critical role in addressing hunger and food insecurity in our community. It is the first line of defense against hunger for low-income residents.\nSNAP benefits respond quickly and effectively to changes in need, whether due to economic downturns or natural disasters. According to recent studies, it is estimated that $1 of SNAP benefits leads to between $1.50 and $1.80 in total economic activity during a recession.\nPolicymakers recognize that household resources needed to pay for basics such as shelter, utility costs and childcare are not available to purchase food.  Under current law, SNAP takes into account the utility expenses of each SNAP household.  States adjust household benefits based on a state-specific Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) calculated by the state and approved by USDA. The current policy allows variances in SUAs to accommodate for differences in utility costs and rates, and allows states flexibility in how they calculate those costs. \n\nThe proposed rule would standardize and cap SUA calculations across the country based on survey data. The proposed rule does not adequately explain USDAs rationale for capping the largest of the SUA components by calibrating to utility expense survey data for those no higher than the 80th percentile of low-income people and then capping other SUA components as well.   The proposed rule merely asserts that it calculated calibrating to the 50th percentile compared to the 80th percentile.  The proposed rule does not adequately explain whether USDA analyzed impacts calibrated to the 85th or higher percentiles and what the results of those estimates were.   The lack of such explanation is particularly concerning given research documented that 21 states had SUAs exceeding the 85th percentile estimates, possibly because in their efforts to mitigate benefit loss for households with very high utility costs. \n\nThe Administration concedes that the proposed rule would cause 19 percent of SNAP households to get lower SNAP monthly benefits, would disproportionately impact elderly people and people with disabilities, and would cause a national net cut to SNAP benefits amounting to $4.5 billion over five years.\n\nThis USDA rulemaking is yet another attempt for the Administration to side step Congress and make cuts to SNAP benefits.

Fewer people come at the start of the month because they have food stamps again. The number of people who come each week generally doubles from the first weekend of the month to the last. Additionally, many people who come prefer to take their meals to go in order to space it out throughout the day. They stretch one meal into three because they cannot afford to eat anything else.People in Vermont are suffering already; these changes would make many suffer even more. I believe that food security is a fundamental right that should not be taken away.

Feeding Texas remains committed to protecting and strengthening SNAP, as it plays a critical role in addressing hunger and food insecurity in our state. At Feeding Texas, we believe that every Texan should have the chance to be healthy and financially secure.\n\nHunger and food insecurity are serious problems in our nation and state. Despite record low unemployment rates, Texas continues to be one of the hungriest states in America and SNAP is the first line of defense for 3.3 million low-income Texans who rely on it to help feed their families. \n\nAccording to recent data for 2018 from the Economic Research Service, 14.0 percent of Texas households were food insecure; well above the national average of 11.7 percent for the same time period.   That means 1.5 million households in Texas worried about how they were going to put food on the table at some point during the year. Texas is tied with California for the largest population of food insecure households in the country, and SNAP is vital to their health and financial well-being.   \n\nHunger disproportionally impacts Texans of color and low-income households.  Nationally food insecurity rates were 5.0 percentage points higher for Hispanics than the general population, and 10 percentage points higher for Blacks.   For low-income households, those below 185 percent of poverty, a staggering 29.1 percent were food insecure in 2018.   While food insecurity data by race and income for Texas are not available, per capita incomes are much lower for Black ($23,471) and Hispanic ($18,228) Texans, which leads to increased food insecurity and increases the importance of SNAP to family food budgets. \n\nBy allowing households to purchase a more adequate diet, SNAP not only fights hunger but research has found that receipt of SNAP in early childhood improved high school graduation rates, adult earnings, and adult health.   SNAP lifted 3.6 million Americans out of poverty in 2016, according to the Census Bureaus Supplemental Poverty Measure. SNAP is nearly as effective as the Earned Income Tax Credit in lifting families above the poverty line, and far more effective than any other program in lifting families out of deep poverty.  \n\nSNAP benefits provide our nations first line of defense against hunger and food insecurity.  The program considers households expenditures for certain non-food basics, such as shelter, utility costs, and childcare, in recognition that those spent resources are not available to pay for food.\n\nUnder current law, SNAP considers the utility expenses of each SNAP household.

This harm would be felt acutely in Vermont, where heating costs are especially high. It would cause serious harm to Vermonters, especially those who are already food insecure such as children, low-income families and elders, our community and the nation. The proposed rule is flaws and should be withdrawn.\n\nAs Program Manager for RiseVT in Bennington County it is my responsibility to ensure healthy options for ALL Vermonters, which includes affordability and accessibility to healthy, nutritious foods. By putting the 3SquaresVT benefits in jeopardy you are, in turn, putting the health of the most vulnerable in jeopardy. This is not acceptable. \n \nSNAP (known in Vermont as 3SquaresVT) plays a critical role in addressing hunger and food insecurity in Vermont. For over 40 years, SNAP has been our nations first line of defense against hunger, because it works. It provides, on average, over 70,000 Vermonters and 40 million Americans with money to spend on food in grocery stores and farmers markets each month. It is proven to reduce hunger, lift people out of poverty, and leads to positive short and long-term health, education, and employment outcomes. \nPolicymakers recognize that household resources needed to pay for basics such as shelter, utility costs and childcare are not available to purchase food. That is why under current law, SNAP takes into account the utility expenses of each SNAP household. States adjust household benefits based on a state-specific Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) calculated by the state and approved by USDA. The current policy allows variances in SUAs to accommodate for differences in utility costs and rates, and allows states flexibility in how they calculate those costs. This is especially important in a state like Vermont, where heating costs are much higher than in other parts of the country.\nThe proposed rule would standardize and cap SUA calculations across the country based on survey data, but does not contain an adequate explanation of USDAs rationale for the methodology or reasoning behind this strategy or its accuracy. One thing is clear: the proposed rule would cause 19 percent of SNAP households to get lower SNAP monthly benefits, would disproportionately impact elderly people and people with disabilities, and would cause a national net cut to SNAP benefits amounting to $4.5 billion over five years. \nIn Vermont, the impact of this proposal would be even more devastating, and only serve to increase hunger in our state and worsen the benefits cliff for thousands of Vermont families working to put enough food on the table for themselves and their families. According to estimates from Vermonts Department for Children and Families, this proposal would cause 68 percent of Vermont households to lose an average of $82 per month in benefits. This equates to over 26,000 Vermont households, and would mean a loss of over $25 million per year to Vermonts food economy. Additionally, 80 percent of 3SquaresVT households with an older adult or Vermonter with a disability would see a cut in their benefits. This is unacceptable in my community.\nThis USDA rulemaking is yet another attempt for the Administration to side step Congress and make cuts to SNAP benefits. Congress reviewed SNAP policy during the 2018 Farm Bill, including the fact that states have options that may produce differences in SNAP eligibility benefit amounts from state to state. Although the Presidents FY 2019 Budget included a request for a change similar to the proposed rule [https://www.obpa.usda.gov/32fns2019notes.pdf], Congress did not include such a change in the 2018 Farm Bill. Indeed, evening out benefit amounts across states by lowering benefits for large numbers of participants does not promote SNAPs statutory purpose, but rather directly undermines and seeks to weaken it.\nUSDA should be strengthening the positive impacts of SNAP for health, well-being and economic activity, not making cuts to SNAP benefits.

According to the Department's analysis, the proposed rule threatens to cut SNAP benefits for 19% of our nation's SNAP caseload, amounting to a $4.5 billion reduction in SNAP benefits over the next 5 years. SNAP is the first line of defense against hunger, helping low income people afford basic nutrition to keep themselves and their families healthy for school and for work. As someone who thinks that it is immoral to let our neighbors go hungry, I urge you to withdraw this deeply flawed and harmful rule.\n\nThe proposed rule would standardize and cap SUA calculations across the country based on survey data. The proposed rule does not adequately explain USDA's rationale for capping the largest of the SUA components by calibrating to utility expense survey data for those no higher than the 80th percentile of low-income people and then capping other SUA components as well.   The proposed rule merely asserts that it calculated calibrating to the 50th percentile compared to the 80th percentile.

The lack of such explanation is particularly concerning given research documented that 21 states had SUAs exceeding the 85th percentile estimates, possibly because in their efforts to mitigate benefit loss for households with very high utility costs. \n\nThe Administration concedes that the proposed rule would cause 19 percent of SNAP households to get lower SNAP monthly benefits, would disproportionately impact elderly people and people with disabilities, and would cause a national net cut to SNAP benefits amounting to $4.5 billion over five years.\n\nHere in Washington State, the impact of the proposed rule would be dramatically worse: according to our state's Department of Social and Health Services, more than 75% of our state's SNAP households could see an average reduction of $47 in monthly benefits. That equates to a 20% reduction in monthly benefits or nearly a week's worth of food for struggling households. Over 350,000 Washington households would see a reduction in their benefits, and that translates to taking food off their tables and exacerbating their struggles with hunger and affording other basic necessities for housing, health care, childcare and transportation.\n\nThe loss of food assistance for these families also translates to a loss of revenue to our local economies. SNAP benefits are dollars spent on buying food from grocery stores, farmers markets, and other food retailers. That puts money in those businesses pockets and generates jobs while putting food on the tables of struggling families. Every cut proposed to SNAP spending only hurts all of us as it means fewer benefits spent in communities which hurts businesses and reduces work hours or available jobs.\n\nNothing in your analysis suggests a need for this proposal or its projected impact of reducing food assistance that is already woefully inadequate to support a household's basic nutritional needs. Instead, this is the third proposal this year that threatens SNAP eligibility and benefits for struggling people suggesting that the only interest at play here is pure animus against low income people. Withdraw this rule and your other rule proposals that cut SNAP for eligible households.\n\nThank you.\n\nSincerely,\nChristina Wong"},{"name":"0900006484164b9b","clust":7,"clust_order":31,"comp":7,"comp_order":31,"text":"November 15, 2019\n\nSNAP Certification Policy Branch,\nProgram Development Division\nFood and Nutrition Services\n3101 Park Center Drive\nU.S. Department of Agriculture\nAlexandria, VA 22302\n\nRe:  Notice of Proposed Rule Making Regarding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances - RIN 0584-AE69 \n\nDear SNAP Certification Policy Branch:\n\nOn behalf of First 5 Alameda County (First 5), I appreciate the opportunity to comment on USDAs Notice of Proposed Rule Making, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program: Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances, published in the federal register on October 3, 2019. \n\nWe strongly oppose the changes proposed by USDA to alter the methodology for calculating standard utility allowances, because of the significant harm the change would inflict on Californias children. According to the Departments own estimates, the proposed rule would lower monthly SNAP benefits for 20 percent of households with children and cause a national net cut to SNAP benefits, amounting to $4.5 billion over five years. These proposed cuts would exacerbate hunger and have harmful and lasting impacts on the health, educational achievement, and well-being of Californias children. \n\nFirst 5 was created with the passage of Californias Proposition 10 in 1998 which emphasizes an integrated, comprehensive, and collaborative system for supporting, and improving the early development of children. For over twenty years, First 5 has worked to improve the lives of children and their families through effective, responsive, and community-driven programming, as well as advocating for policies that address persistent racial and economic inequities. By advancing programs and public policies that address structural inequality, we believe we can narrow disparities and give Alameda County children the best start in life. \n\nTherefore, we understand the importance of SNAP to children and their families. Our nations largest food security program is also one of our most effective anti-poverty measures, expanding household budgets and lifting nearly 5 million people nationwide and 800,000 Californians out of poverty in 2014.  More than 74% of California SNAP participants belong to families with children and over 100,000 Alameda County residents receive SNAP benefits. \n \nSNAP benefits persist well beyond childhood. Studies indicate that receipt of SNAP in early childhood leads to improved high school graduation rates, adult earnings, and adult health.  The proposed changes to Categorical Eligibility in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program \n\n\nwill directly harm the long-term prospects of young children and their families.  Therefore, we believe the proposed rule is misguided and urge you to withdraw it.\n\nSNAP Fights Child Food Insecurity and Child Poverty\nChildren need food to grow, to develop, and to be healthy, but two million California children live in low-income households that do not have access to enough food and 435 of children in our county are food insecure.  SNAP plays a critical role in improving access to food for children in our community and across the state. As the nations largest federal food assistance program, SNAP provides low-income households with monthly funds specifically designated for food, and benefited over 1.9 million California children in 2018 and close to 10,000 children Alameda County .  Beyond its role in fighting food insecurity, SNAP lifted 3.2 million Americans out of poverty in 2018, according to the Census Bureaus Supplemental Poverty Measure. Cuts to SNAP would have devastating effects for Californias children.  \n\nThe Proposed Rule Will Disproportionately Harm Households with Children\nIn its Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) of the proposed rule, USDA acknowledges standardizing and capping SUA calculations will result in 19% of SNAP households with children experiencing a SNAP benefit cut of $336 annually, on average. However, this estimate is based on data from 2014. Other organizations have estimated the potential impact to be much higher, with up to 68% of affected households being households with children.  Better and updated data is needed to fully reflect the potential harm of the SNAP benefit cut on households with children. In addition, the USDA analysis does not estimate the rippling effects of this proposed rule on children. SNAP is more effective than any other program in lifting families out of deep poverty and is known to improve high school graduation rates, adult earnings, and participants overall health.  A decision to cut SNAP benefits must analyze the impacts it will have on the health and well-being of our nations children. We strongly oppose the proposed rule and request the USDA withdraw the rule and work with states to improve their SUAs under existing flexibility.\n\nSincerely,\n \nKristin Spanos \nChief Executive Officer\nFirst 5 Alameda County\n"},{"name":"09000064841db4e4","clust":7,"clust_order":32,"comp":7,"comp_order":32,"text":"December 2, 2019\n\nSNAP Certification Policy Branch\nProgram Development Division\nFood and Nutrition Services\n3101 Park Center Drive\nU.S. Department of Agriculture\nAlexandria, VA 22302\n\nRe:  Notice of Proposed Rule Making Regarding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances -- RIN 0584-AE69 \n\nSubmitted via Regulations.gov\n\nDear SNAP Certification Policy Branch:\n\nOn behalf of the Wisconsin Council of Churches, we appreciate the opportunity to comment on U.S.D.A.'s Notice of Proposed Rule regarding Supplemental Assistance Nutrition Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances. \n\nAccording to the Department's own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years. Many low-income people in Wisconsin already struggle to both put food on their family's table and pay for essential utilities to heat and cool their homes. This rule would make life harder for these people, harming their health and well-being. \n\nIn addition, it would harm Wisconsin communities - most SNAP benefits are spent in local businesses and provide essential nutrition that helps workers to be productive and children to learn.  SNAP improves recipients' health, thus reducing health care costs that would otherwise be borne, one way or another, by the community. It responds rapidly to increased need due to economic downturns or unemployment, but also to improved economic conditions, thus helping to stabilize the financial situation of households and communities.\n\nThis deeply flawed rule, therefore, should be withdrawn.  \n\nThe Wisconsin Council of Churches (WCC) is a network of Christian churches and faith-based organizations committed to working together across our many differences. The Council connects 20 Christian traditions, which have within them approximately 2,000 congregations and over one million church members. Exercising holy imagination, we help one another make courageous choices that lead toward peacemaking, social and economic justice for Wisconsin's most vulnerable residents, the vitality of the church, and the well-being of our neighbors.  \n\nOur members find common ground in their concern to alleviate hunger in their communities through direct service activities, such as food pantries and soup kitchens.  However, we recognize that such activities, though essential, are limited. Programs like SNAP are indispensable for ensuring that our neighbors with limited means can live healthy and productive lives, and care for themselves and their families.  These programs must be kept strong, effective, adequate, and available to all who need them. This proposed rule is a step in exactly the wrong direction.\n \nSNAP is the first line of defense against hunger for low-income residents.  According to the U.S.D.A.'s own report on food security in the U.S. in 2018, nearly one in ten Wisconsin households lacked assured access to adequate, nutritious food at some time during the year.  The consequences experiencing food insecurity in childhood can last a lifetime.  \n\nThe proposed change to the Standard Utility Allowance lacks a coherent rationale.  The proposed rule would standardize and cap SUA calculations across the country based on survey data. The proposed rule does not adequately explain why the U.S.D.A. would cap the largest of the SUA components by calibrating to utility expense survey data for those no higher than the 80th percentile of low-income people and then capping other SUA components as well.   The proposed rule merely asserts that it calculated calibrating to the 50th percentile compared to the 80th percentile.  The proposed rule does not adequately explain whether U.S.D.A. analyzed impacts calibrated to the 85th or higher percentiles and what the results of those estimates were.   The lack of such explanation is particularly concerning given research documented that 21 states had SUAs exceeding the 85th percentile estimates, possibly because in their efforts to mitigate benefit loss for households with very high utility costs. \n\nThe Administration concedes that the proposed rule would cause 19 percent of SNAP households to get lower SNAP monthly benefits, would disproportionately impact elderly people and people with disabilities, and would cause a national net cut to SNAP benefits amounting to $4.5 billion over five years.  \n\nThese harms to the most vulnerable members of our community are unacceptable. Instead of making cuts to SNAP benefits, U.S.D.A. should be strengthening the SNAP to increase its positive benefits for health, well-being and economic activity.  We strongly oppose the proposed rule and request the U.S.D.A. withdraw the rule and work with states to improve their SUA's under existing flexibility.\n\nSincerely,\n \nDr. Peter W.

I help our states older clients complete applications and maintain their benefits. This is often their \"make or break\" for being able to live on their own, have the lowest threshold of financial well being, and maintain some sort of healthy eating habit. \n\n\nAccording to estimates from Vermonts Department for Children and Families (the agency that administers 3SquaresVT), this rule would mean that 26,000 Vermont households would receive a cut in their 3SquaresVT benefits, on average losing $82 per month for food; thats over 3 in 5 3SquaresVT households. It would harm older Vermonters and people with disabilities at an even higher rate; 80 percent of these households would receive a cut. Additionally, with nearly $26 million fewer dollars per year coming into our state to help people in need buy more and better food, our local retailers and state economy would be harmed. This is unacceptable in my community. The benefits to our older community is imperative to their independent survival. Those receiving benefits rely on the funds to maintain their lives in their homes. Decreasing this  would drastically change their financial situation and thus directly effect their living situation, putting more older Vermonters at risk. \n\nIn a rural and cold-weather state like Vermont, people who struggle to make ends meet have a lot of obstacles to overcome.

They make a huge difference in the lives of low-income Vermonters and the health of our state as a whole, and should remain strong and accessible.\n\nSincerely,\nJoan Wagner\n"},{"name":"090000648414e701","clust":7,"clust_order":38,"comp":7,"comp_order":38,"text":"November 12, 2019\n\nSNAP Program Design Branch,\nProgram Development Division\nFood and Nutrition Service\n3101 Park Center Drive\nU.S. Department of Agriculture\nAlexandria, VA 22302\n \nRe:  Notice of Proposed Rule Making Regarding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances -- RIN 0584-AE69\n \nDear SNAP Program Design Branch:\n \nThank you for the opportunity to comment on USDAs Notice of Proposed Rule regarding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances. According to the Departments own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years. I want to voice my strong opposition to this proposal; if it goes into effect, this will cause serious harm to Vermonters in my community, as well as people across the country. The proposed rule should be withdrawn.\n\n3SquaresVT (our states name for SNAP) is Vermonts first line of defense against hunger. It helps Vermonters afford enough food for themselves and their families, pulls people out of poverty, helps people learn and find and keep jobs, and improves health, both in the short term and in the long term.\n\nThe proposed changes would exacerbate the struggles many low-income people already face in paying for both heat and utilities. This harm would be felt acutely in Vermont, where heating costs are especially high. In this state, and in Bennington County, we know that household resources needed to pay for basics such as shelter, utility costs and childcare are not available to purchase food. The Standard Utility Allowance (SUA), currently calculated by states and approved by the USDA, allows states flexibility in calculating the costs of utility costs and rates. Under current law, SNAP considers the utility expenses of each SNAP household. This SUA flexibility is crucial in a state like Vermont, where heating costs are much higher than in other parts of the country.\nThe proposed rule would standardize and cap SUA calculations across the country based on survey data but does not contain an adequate explanation of USDAs rationale for the methodology or reasoning behind this strategy or its accuracy. One thing is clear: the proposed rule would cause 19 percent of SNAP households to get lower SNAP monthly benefits, would disproportionately impact elderly people and people with disabilities, and would cause a national net cut to SNAP benefits amounting to $4.5 billion over five years. \n\n\n\nAccording to estimates from Vermonts Department for Children and Families (the agency that administers 3SquaresVT), this rule would mean that 26,000 Vermont households would receive a cut in their 3SquaresVT benefits, on average losing $82 per month for food; thats over 3 in 5 3SquaresVT households. With 17% of children in Bennington County living below the poverty line that rely on monthly SNAP benefits (greater than the overall rate of 13% in Vermont), families with young children in the county will feel this change acutely. It would harm older Vermonters and people with disabilities at an even higher rate; 80 percent of these households would receive a cut. The American Community Survey indicates that 22% of the population of Bennington County, VT is 65 or older, and that number continues to climb as the median age in Bennington increases. These cuts would be devastating to the health and welfare of our senior citizens.  Additionally, with nearly $26 million fewer dollars per year coming into our state to help people in need buy more and better food, our local retailers and state economy would be harmed. This is unacceptable in my community and my state. \n\nIn a rural and cold-weather state like Vermont, people who struggle to make ends meet have a lot of obstacles to overcome. It is harmful and misguided to attempt to weaken a program that is proven to help people buy more and better food, especially at this time of year that presents additional challenges to individuals and families. Please dont make accessing food even harder for the thousands of Vermonters and millions of Americans working hard to stay healthy while covering their bills and keeping the heat on. Instead of proposing to cut 3SquaresVT, I urge you to work to increase wages and improve access to housing, healthcare, and food assistance programs like 3SquaresVT. They make a huge difference in the lives of low-income Vermonters and the health of our state as a whole and should remain strong and accessible.\n\nSincerely,\n\nKathleen OReilly \nManchester Center, VT 05255\n"},{"name":"09000064840ea2c2","clust":8,"clust_order":1,"comp":2,"comp_order":1,"text":"SNAP cuts have dangerous impacts on health and well-being as well as on the economy.

According to the Department's own estimates, the proposed rule would lower monthly SNAP benefits for 25 percent of participating California households; disproportionately harm seniors and people with disabilities; and cause a national net cut to SNAP benefits, amounting to $4.5 billion over five years. As with previously proposed rules, the Administration's estimates likely do not take into account the full range of harm caused by the proposed policy. Better and more recent data is needed to accurately estimate the rule's impact on California. It is clear that USDA's proposed cuts would have harmful impacts on the health and well-being of Californians and our economy while exacerbating the existing struggles many low-income Californians face in paying for food and utilities. We believe the proposed rule is misguided, flawed, and should be withdrawn. \n\nTransitions Clinic Network is a national non-profit that supports primary care clinics in implementing special programs from individuals with chronic health conditions returning to the community from incarceration. We have worked with 21 clinics in California and 39 nationally to implement this program. In a large research study, we found that 25% of our clients nationally experienced extreme food insecurityover 24 hours without food. Most of the individuals who are eligible for care in our programs are older and have more than one chronic health condition. They rely on SNAP benefits to survive. Without these benefits, their health and reentry outcomes would worsen.\n\nBenefit levels for SNAP are based on income and other factors including utility expenses, which can often be deducted from a low-income household's gross income. Policymakers have long recognized that when households use their already limited resources to pay for basics such as housing, child care, and utilities it impacts their ability to purchase food. Under current law, SNAP takes into account these expenses, including the costs of utilities for each SNAP household, to better reflect participant's true cost of living and to more accurately assess their food assistance needs. For utilities, states adjust household benefits based on a state-specific Standard Utility Allowance (SUA), calculated by the state and approved by USDA. The current policy allows variances in SUAs to accommodate for differences in utility costs and rates, and allows states necessary flexibility in how they calculate those costs. \n\nThe proposed rule would standardize and cap SUA calculations across the country based on survey data. The proposed rule does not adequately explain USDA's rationale for capping the largest of the SUA components by calibrating to utility expense survey data for those no higher than the 80th percentile of low-income people and then capping other SUA components as well. The proposed rule merely asserts that it calculated calibrating to the 50th percentile compared to the 80th percentile. The proposed rule does not adequately explain whether USDA analyzed impacts calibrated to the 85th or higher percentiles and what the results of those estimates were. The lack of such explanation is particularly concerning given research documented that 21 states had SUAs exceeding the 85th percentile estimates, possibly because in their efforts to mitigate benefit loss for households with very high utility costs. \n\nThis USDA rulemaking is yet another attempt for the Administration to side step Congress and make cuts to SNAP benefits. Congress reviewed SNAP policy during the 2018 Farm Bill, including the fact that states have options that may produce differences in SNAP eligibility benefit amounts from state to state. Although the President's FY 2019 Budget included a request for a change similar to the proposed rule, Congress did not include such a change in the 2018 Farm Bill. Indeed, evening out benefit amounts across states by lowering benefits for large numbers of participants does not promote and instead undermines SNAP's statutory purpose.\n\nUSDA should be strengthening the positive impacts of SNAP for health, well-being and economic activity, not making cuts to SNAP benefits. We strongly oppose the proposed rule and request the USDA withdraw the rule and work with states to improve their SUA's under existing flexibility.\n\n\nSincerely, \n\nShira Shavit, MD\nExecutive Director,\nTransitions Clinic Network\n\n\n\n"},{"name":"09000064841d3447","clust":25,"clust_order":2,"comp":27,"comp_order":2,"text":"To Whom It May Concern: \n\nThank you for the opportunity to comment on the Food and Nutrition Services (FNS) Notice of Public Rule Making (NPRM) for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program: Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances published on October 3, 2019. As a public health practitioner and researcher, I am deeply troubled by the proposed rule and my comments express strong opposition to this rule change. This proposal is one component of a sustained and systematic effort to undermine SNAP, a federal food assistance program serving low-income Americans affected by hunger. SNAP provides almost 40 million Americans with a vital safety net that increases food security, reduces poverty, and improves health outcomes. I am deeply saddened to see efforts to destabilize a program that addresses basic needs for children, older adults, and economically vulnerable populations across the country.\n\nI have been fortunate enough to work to improve health and reduce disease at the federal, state, and local levels, working alongside dedicated public health professionals at the Centers for Disease Control, the New Hampshire Division of Public Health Services, and Public Health  Seattle & King County. In these roles, as well as through my Master of Public Health training and my current research as a sociology PhD student at Syracuse University, I have seen both rigorous data and heart-wrenching personal stories affirming a basic truth of public healththat social factors, far more than healthcare, determine how long and healthy peoples lives will be. Without basic economic security, and especially without access to adequate and nutritious food, an individuals risk of disease increases dramatically. Specific debilitating effects of food insecurity includes delayed development and underperformance in school for your children, mental and behavioral issues, chronic disease, unemployment, and premature death. It is a basic social justice issue to ensure that citizens of the wealthiest country in the world are not going hungry. In addition, supporting programs like SNAP that improve food affordability and availability will improve population health, reducing healthcare costs and allowing millions to contribute positively to the economy and their community. \n\nThe current policy requires that individual states use a Standard Utility Allowance (SUA), or the states average utility cost, to calculate a households total shelter costs and determine their monthly SNAP benefit. The proposed rule change would standardize and cap SUA calculations across the country, undermining states flexibility, failing to account for regional differences in utility costs, rates, and usage, and exacerbating financial hardship for households with high utilities costs. This proposed rule would financially burden the very people who are most in need of support, targeting those with the fewest financial resources and the greatest vulnerability. This proposed rule will cut SNAP by $4.5 billion over 5 years, with disproportionate negative impacts on older adults, people with disabilities, and working families. For some, the proposed rule would reduce benefits, and for others SNAP eligibility would be lost completely. \n\nFor the reasons discussed above and many others, I strongly urge you to withdraw this proposal in full immediately in order to avoid harmful impacts on the health and well-being of over seven million Americans, including three million children.\nSincerely,\nClaire Pendergrast, MPH\n"},{"name":"09000064841ccb98","clust":26,"clust_order":1,"comp":28,"comp_order":1,"text":"Too often our tax dollars are spent on programs that don't immediately benefit our citizens.

Standardizing & capping SUA allowances is an unfair, mean-spirited way to deprive over 7 million people with all their needed food & nutrition security just because they happen to live in areas with relatively high utility costs. Therefor I strongly oppose the proposed rule and insist the USDA withdraw it from further consideration. The proposed rule is an attempt to cut money spent on SNAP on the backs of millions of Americans who live in higher utility cost regions. But why cut SNAP at all?

People in the margins will die. You cannot understand the desperation unless you have been there.

This would disproportionately impact seniors and people with disabilities, and would cause a $4.5 billion cut -- over five years -- to SNAP benefits.

I currently depend on SNAP benefits, without which I would eventually starve and die. Im always careful with my monthly ration and do my best to still have a balanced diet with as much nutrition as possible, but in fairness it should really increase by 25% to keep up with current prices in my area. If theres any chance that new legislation would cause my monthly SNAP benefit to drop, then I would definitely oppose it.

Sonny Perdue, RIN: 0584-AE69; Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program: Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances The SNAP program is intended to supplement food for individuals and families who cannot afford adequate nutrition without this help. The standardization of heating & cooling utility allowance does not recognize the reality that utility expenses can vary drastically--even in the same area--based on a number of factors, including type of heating utilized, insulation factors, etc. Lower utility expense allowances would reduce SNAP benefits for those who most need this assistance. Housing, utilities and childcare are other expenses that must be considered--the amount paid on these takes away for the potential amount available to buy food! States are more aware of the unique factors that affect their own areas, which is why they are more qualified to determine what factors should be used to calculate costs in their own geographic area. This is what is done currently, and should not be standardized! SNAP should be expanded, not cut, especially considering that while unemployment may be less, so are wages!

It helps Vermonters afford enough food for themselves and their families, pulls people out of poverty, helps people learn and find and keep jobs, and improves health, both in the short term and in the long term. This program helped my aunt and uncle keep heat on in the winter and with providing enough food to their children when they had two young children. Despite being two working parents, one of which had just completed military service, the cost of living exceeded their income, which is common in many Vermont communities. This problem is exacerbated by increased rent in urban centers like Burlington, and long commute distances in rural areas. I have personally known dozens of people in my life who used SNAP to survive the winter (which is often -20 degrees Fahrenheit in the mountains in January, I note this to demonstrate that access to heating is crucial.  \n\nAccording to estimates from Vermont's Department for Children and Families (the agency that administers 3SquaresVT), this rule would mean that 26,000 Vermont households would receive a cut in their 3SquaresVT benefits, on average losing $82 per month for food; that's over 3 in 5 3SquaresVT households. It would harm older Vermonters and people with disabilities at an even higher rate; 80 percent of these households would receive a cut. Additionally, with nearly $26 million fewer dollars per year coming into our state to help people in need buy more and better food, our local retailers and state economy would be harmed.

It is not a matter of simply low-income Vermonters going into debt to survive, but impacts direct survival as without adequate heating, winter conditions in this state are deadly. Even for those who manage to keep their heat on, they may keep the heat low and eat less, which is dangerous for the elderly, disabled people, young children, and those with medical conditions that rely on SNAP. \n\nEspecially at this time of year, it is cruel and misguided to attempt to weaken a program that is proven to help people buy more and better food.

As a citizen and someone with many low-income members of my family, I believe that the proposed rule should be withdrawn.  According to the Department's own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years. If it goes into effect, this will cause serious harm to people in my community, as well as to people across the country.\n\n3SquaresVT (SNAP in Vermont) helps many thousands of Vermonters afford enough food for themselves and their families.  There is a great deal of research that shows SNAP pulls people out of poverty, helps people find and keep jobs, keeps families together, and improves health, both in the short term and in the long term.  My own 74-year-old mother is a perfect example.  She has worked her whole life, and is still working.  She served many foster children, and elderly and sick people throughout her lifejobs that pay very little and made it very difficult for her to save.  If it wasn't for me providing her with housing and financial help, she would be destitute.  She has used SNAP at times in her life, and it has made a huge difference, even though she never qualified for more than the minimum benefit.  Under these new proposed rule changes, it is likely she would not qualify for a benefit at all.  My immediate family is luckymy spouse and I have good paying jobs and can support my mother.  Most families in the U.S. don't have that luxury, especially as the cost of housing and food and utilities keep rising.  What is gained by making it even harderespecially for the elderly and the disabledto buy food and stay healthy?  I would think it would cost far more to have our Medicare and Medicaid systems address their increased health problems due to a lack of proper nutrition.\n\nAccording to estimates from Vermont's Department for Children and Families (the agency that administers 3SquaresVT), this rule would mean that 26,000 Vermont households would receive a cut in their 3SquaresVT benefits, on average losing $82 per month for food; that's over 3 in 5 3SquaresVT households.

Additionally, with nearly $26 million fewer dollars per year coming into our state to help people in need buy more and better food, our local retailers and state economy would be harmed. This is unacceptable.  We need every available job in Vermont right now, and this proposal would also harm many small businesses in Vermont, which also happen to be the only stores selling food in many of our small towns.\n\nIn a rural and cold-weather state like Vermont, people who struggle to make ends meet have a lot of obstacles to overcome. Especially at this time of year, it is cruel and misguided to attempt to weaken a program that is proven to help people buy more and better food.

I want to voice my strong opposition to this proposal; if it goes into effect, this will cause serious harm to Vermonters in my community, as well as people across the country. The proposed rule should be withdrawn.\n\n3SquaresVT (our state's name for SNAP) is Vermont's first line of defense against hunger. It helps Vermonters afford enough food for themselves and their families, pulls people out of poverty, helps people learn and find and keep jobs, and improves health, both in the short term and in the long term. For the past six and a half years, I have worked for an organization called Hunger Free Vermont, whose mission is to fight the injustice of hunger and malnutrition for all Vermonters. Much of my position revolves around SNAP - ensuring that eligible Vermonters are aware of the program and able to apply, working with state and federal partners to remove undue barriers to access and participation, and now fighting threat after threat to the program. I know that this program is essential for thousands of members of my community because I see its impacts firsthand - for many of them, it is their only money for food, and it's already not enough. SNAP means that a woman in the Northeast Kingdom can feed herself in addition to her grandson, that a family in Rutland can run their heater all winter, that a disabled Vermonter in Brattleboro can live independently, and that an older adult in Barre can afford more than tea and toast. It's easy to think of this program in numbers and dollar figures, but that's only part of the story. SNAP keeps people healthy, thriving, and alive. It is our duty to make sure it does this, and does this well.\n\nAccording to estimates from Vermont's Department for Children and Families (the agency that administers SNAP), this rule would mean that 26,000 Vermont households would receive a cut in their SNAP benefits, on average losing $82 per month for food; that's over 3 in 5 SNAP households. It would harm older Vermonters and people with disabilities at an even higher rate; 80 percent of these households would receive a cut. Additionally, with nearly $26 million fewer dollars per year coming into our state to help people in need buy more and better food, our local retailers and state economy would be harmed. This is unacceptable in my community. \n\nDuring this public comment period, I have heard from so many Vermonters who are touched by this program; they are frustrated, outraged, and confused, but mostly, they're afraid. Afraid of what will happen if this proposal goes into effect. One woman I spoke to today was in tears; she said that if she loses her SNAP benefits she doesn't know how she will be able to live. What should I say to her? I'm not sure a discussion of the merits of different SUA methodologies will provide any comfort. \n\nIn a rural and cold-weather state like Vermont, people who struggle to make ends meet have a lot of obstacles to overcome. Especially at this time of year, it is cruel and misguided to attempt to weaken a program that is proven to help people buy more and better food. Please don't make accessing food even harder for the thousands of Vermonters and millions of Americans working hard to stay healthy while covering their bills and keeping the heat on. Instead of proposing to cut SNAP, I urge you to work to increase wages and improve access to housing, healthcare, and food assistance programs like SNAP. They make a huge difference in the lives of low-income Vermonters and the health of our state as a whole, and should remain strong and accessible.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDrake Turner"},{"name":"09000064841dcce3","clust":79,"clust_order":3,"comp":32,"comp_order":3,"text":"Re: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).

According to the Departments own estimates, the proposed rule would cut SNAP benefits by $4.5 billion over five years. I want to voice my strong opposition to this proposal; if it goes into effect, this will cause serious harm to Vermonters in my community, as well as people across the country. The proposed rule should be withdrawn. 3SquaresVT (our states name for SNAP) is Vermonts first line of defense against hunger. It helps Vermonters afford enough food for themselves and their families, pulls people out of poverty, helps people learn and find and keep jobs, and improves health, both in the short term and in the long term. This program is so incredibly important in providing healthy food to the food-insecure population my hospital serves. According to estimates from Vermonts Department for Children and Families (the agency that administers 3SquaresVT), this rule would mean that 26,000 Vermont households would receive a cut in their 3SquaresVT benefits, on average losing $82 per month for food; thats over 3 in 5 3SquaresVT households. It would harm older Vermonters and people with disabilities at an even higher rate; 80 percent of these households would receive a cut. Additionally, with nearly $26 million fewer dollars per year coming into our state to help people in need buy more and better food, our local retailers and state economy would be harmed. This is unacceptable in my community. As a Registered Dietitian, many of the patients I see rely on programs, such as this, to provide them with healthy and nutritious foods. In a rural and cold-weather state like Vermont, people who struggle to make ends meet have a lot of obstacles to overcome. Especially at this time of year, it is cruel and misguided to attempt to weaken a program that is proven to help people buy more and better food. Please dont make accessing food even harder for the thousands of Vermonters and millions of Americans working hard to stay healthy while covering their bills and keeping the heat on. Instead of proposing to cut 3SquaresVT, I urge you to work to increase wages and improve access to housing, healthcare, and food assistance programs like 3SquaresVT. They make a huge difference in the lives of low-income Vermonters and the health of our state as a whole, and should remain strong and accessible. Sincerely,"},{"name":"0900006484130d57","clust":79,"clust_order":5,"comp":32,"comp_order":5,"text":"Dear SNAP Program Design Branch:\n \nThank you for the opportunity to comment on USDAs Notice of Proposed Rule regarding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances.

Sonny Perdue, RIN: 0584-AE69; Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program: Standardization of State Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowances It is a disgrace that the richest country in the world would even consider cutting funds that help feed some of the most vulnerable American people. Not only would it affect the most vulnerable among us, it would deprive students of needed nutrition to help them adequately learn in school. People are not on public assistance for the fun of it. Do not make their lives even harder by withholding nutrition. If our government is so hard up they are considering cutting food assistance, then start taxing corporations and the rich to help out. This is a disgrace! The Trump administrations proposed rule -- standardizing and capping Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) calculations across the country does not accommodate for differences in utility costs and rates and would result in dramatic cuts to the SNAP food stamps program. The administrations own data concedes that the proposed rule would cause 19 percent of SNAP households to get lower SNAP monthly benefits. This would disproportionately impact seniors and people with disabilities, and would cause a $4.5 billion cut -- over five years -- to SNAP benefits. The current policy, on the other hand, allows states flexibility in how they calculate the costs of SUAs to accommodate for variances from one state to the next. States must be allowed to calculate the costs of utilities as they account for SNAP benefits. I strongly oppose the USDAs new, proposed rule. Please withdraw the rule from further consideration.

If enacted, the rule would have a doubly negative impact in Ohio. It would reduce the average amount of SNAP benefits received monthly for approximately 41% of recipients while contributing to $250 million in annual economic activity loses. We strongly oppose the proposed formula changes and urge the Department of Agriculture to withdraw the rule. \n\nLutheran Metropolitan Ministry (LMM) is a 50-year-old non-profit providing innovative social enterprise job-training, civic engagement strategies and safety net services for the City of Cleveland and across Northeast Ohio. Our mission leads us to operate programs that change lives, transform communities and enliven community engagement. LMM provides guardianship services to over 800 individuals deemed incompetent by the courts, runs a social enterprise that provides culinary training to women currently incarcerated so when released, they have the skills needed for employment, manages a youth shelter and two youth independent living sites, and provides mental health services to clients participating in LMM programs. In addition to these services, LMM operates the Men's Shelter at 2100 Lakeside in downtown Cleveland, Ohio's largest emergency shelter which serves an average of 400 men per night, and operates the Haven Home, an overflow shelter that serves up to 80 women and children. In 2018, we served more than 7,000 individuals across our five service areas. It is our experience serving these individuals that leads LMM to comment on the currently proposed rule.  \n\nAs part of the SNAP program, recipients are awarded a SUA to cover a household's heating and utility expenses. We are concerned that the proposed rule, which would standardize the eligible deduction nationwide, will lead to a reduction in SNAP benefits in some households, thereby forcing individuals to choose between food and utilities. Food is one of the greatest needs for residents in Ohio. Nearly 1.7 million Ohioans (14.5% of the population) are food insecure and 83% live below the Federal poverty line. In Cuyahoga County where LMM is located, 18.6 percent of households qualify for SNAP. This exceeds Ohio's statewide averages for metro areas (14.6 percent), small towns (15.6 percent) and rural areas (15.6 percent).   \n\nIt is therefore alarming that Ohio is one of sixteen states hardest hit by the formula change. Under the proposed rule 41% of Ohioans who receive SNAP would lose out on benefits. Of those who do lose benefits, recipients would lose an average of $45 a month - or $540 a year. This is significant as the average SNAP recipient receives average monthly benefits of $126.   \n\nWe are also concerned regarding the impact that this rule would have on older Ohioans. Ohio is one of the 10 worst states for hunger for older adults. More than 1 in 6 older adults (18 percent) of those 60 and older face hunger. In the past 5 years, the percent of seniors in Cuyahoga County who qualify for SNAP increased by 20 percent which is likely a result of the county's rapidly aging population; by 2030, 31 percent of Cuyahoga County will be 60 years of age and older.  \n\nAccording to USDA Food and Nutrition Services estimates, under the proposed rule, Ohio's SUA would be cut by an estimated 31%, or $155. Households with seniors and/or individuals with disabilities, as well as families with especially high shelter costs are likely to see the biggest benefit cuts, since they benefit most from SNAP's shelter expense deduction.  \n\nLastly, in addition to the negative impact this rule change would have on vulnerable Ohioans, the rule change would have adverse effects on Ohio's economy. This rule would leave Ohio to lose $144 million per year in SNAP benefits which translates to nearly $250 million in losses in annual economic activity. SNAP provides $168 million worth of groceries per month to Ohio, and roughly $2 billion per year. This formula change could cause widespread grocery store closures in communities with high SNAP usage, lost jobs, and the creation of new food deserts. \n\nDue to the clear negative impact on Ohioans and Ohio's economy, we ask that the Administration reconsider this proposed rule. If implemented, it will put families in the precarious position of having to decide between heating or cooling their homes and putting food on the table.  \n"},{"name":"09000064841db3e7","clust":81,"clust_order":2,"comp":75,"comp_order":2,"text":"I am writing on behalf of Lutheran Metropolitan Ministry in response to the U.S. Department of Agricultures proposal to standardize the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programs (SNAP) Standard Utility Allowances (SUA).
