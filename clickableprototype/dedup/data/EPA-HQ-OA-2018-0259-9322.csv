The best policy decisions are informed by science.  For example, if your child had a severe medical condition, you would not disregard the opinions of those physicians with the greatest expertise.  That would be disastrously irresponsible.

As such, Iam writing to strongly oppose the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) proposal to restrict the science that is used in its decisionmaking processes.

In issuing this proposed rule, the EPA claims that it would be making science more transparent. But it instead would put researchers in the difficult position of choosing between protecting privacy and security versus allowing their work to be used in EPA decisionmaking. It would excessively burden EPA staff with reanalyzing data from each study used to support a rulemaking which is not only pointless as peer review already is a check on the work of researchers, but it would be resource intensive and time consuming.
 
The EPA's proposed rule has three fundamental flaws that render it unfeasible. 

First, the agency provides insufficient justification and analyses to support the rule. The proposal includes no analyses of the rule's effect on the EPA's mission-related work, the costs or benefits of such a move, and the problem that such a rule is addressing.

Second, the proposal would restrict the agency's ability to implement and enforce mission-critical laws by blocking the EPA from using many kinds of scientific studies vital to its decisionmaking, including studies that rely on personal health data, confidential business information, intellectual property, or older studies for which the authors or data sources may not be accessible. 

Finally, the rule would grant the EPA administrator broad authority to exclude individual studies or entire decisions from being subject to its provisions on a case-by-case basis, giving the administrator unprecedented power to decide what the best available science is. 

The rule does nothing to advance the cause of transparency in the broader scientific community. This issue is best addressed with the full involvement of scientists, science advisors, and scientific institutions, not designed solely by political appointees.

The EPA must not move forward with this rulemaking as it would undermine science-based decisionmaking at the agency, and limit its ability to protect public health and the environment.

The Covid 19 pandemic offers us a powerful example of why we need rigorous, peer reviewed, objective science to guide government agencies policy decisions.  Science must never be politicized,  and must never be watered down or dismissed  because of its impact on the economy.

I am a concerned American citizen writing to VERY STRONGLY OPPOSE the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) HORRIBLE proposal that would restrict the science that is used in its decision making processes. OBJECTIVE SCIENTIFIC  INFORMATION IS DESPERATELY NEEDED IN ALL EPA MATTERS! To restrict such information is extremely foolhardy and absolutely NOT in our nations best interest!!!

In issuing this ridiculous proposed rule, the EPA claims that it would be making science more transparent which I think you know is not true! But  instead it would put researchers in the very difficult position of choosing between protecting privacy and security versus allowing their work to be used in EPA decisionmaking. It would  excessively burden EPA staff with reanalyzing data from each study used to support a rulemaking which is not only pointless as peer review already is a check on the work of researchers, but it would be resource intensive and time consuming. In short it would be disastrous and produce very bad results!!
 
The EPA's proposed rule has three fundamental flaws that render it COMPLETELY AND TOALLY UNFEASIBLE! 

First, the agency definitely provides insufficient justification and analyses to support the rule. The proposal includes NO analyses of the rule's effect on the EPA's mission-related work, the costs or benefits of such a move, and the problem that such a rule is addressing!!

Second, the proposal would absolutely restrict the agency's ability to implement and enforce mission-critical laws by blocking the EPA from using many kinds of scientific studies that are COMPLETELY VITAL to its decisionmaking, including studies that rely on personal health data, confidential business information, intellectual property, or older studies for which the authors or data sources may not be accessible. 

Finally, the rule would grant the EPA administrator ABSURD AND COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE broad authority to exclude individual studies or entire decisions from being subject to its provisions on a case-by-case basis, giving the administrator despicable, unprecedented power to decide what the best available science is!! THIS WOULD BE NOTHING SHORT OF IMMORAL, INSANE  AND COMPLETELY WRONG!! 

The rule does nothing to ACTUALLY ADVANCE the cause of transparency in the broader scientific community!! This issue is best addressed with the FULL AND TOTAL  involvement of scientists, science advisors, and scientific institutions, NOT designed solely by ANY political appointees!!! TO ALLOW THIS HORRIFIC PROPOSED RULE WOULD BE COMPLETELY IRRATIONAL AND GO AGAINST THE VERY MISSION AND INTENDED PURPOSE OF THE EPA!!! PLEASE DO NOT GO FORWARD WITH THIS PROPOSED RULE CHANGE!! OUR NATIONS PUBLIC HEALTH IN AT STAKE AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF AMERICANS DO NOT WANT TO SEE THIS RULE  CHANGE HAPPEN, NOT NOW, NOT EVER!!!!!!!!

I am writing to strongly oppose the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) proposal to restrict the science that is used in its decisionmaking processes.

The American people created and support with their tax contribution the ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY. #45 and his Cabinet do not want a scientifically working EPA because it stops the polluters profits. We desperately need the EPAs scientific overview of corporations that prioritize their profits over and above our environment and the impact it has on our health and wellbeing. #45 and his Cabinet are destroying the world environment our children will inherit. We cannot allow it. #45 and his Cabinet are all our employees. We also support them with almost our exclusive tax contribution since #45 and his tax reform has eliminated any corporations obligation to contribute their fair tax. We are the American people, the only power that can stop this extreme abuse. We believe in Science. Scientists dedicate their lives and time to find ways to help humans to live in harmony with nature in order we preserve our survival on Earth. #45 and his denial of Science have become our worst enemy. Lets stop #45s irrational goal to remove Science and scientist from protecting our basic interest of living in a clean environment. No change in EPA regulations!

It would excessively burden EPA staff with reanalyzing data from each study used to support a rulemaking which is not only pointless as peer review already is a check on the work of researchers, but it would be resource intensive and time consuming.
 
The EPA's proposed rule has three fundamental flaws that render it unfeasible. 

First, the agency provides insufficient justification and analyses to support the rule. The proposal includes no analyses of the rule's effect on the EPA's mission-related work, the costs or benefits of such a move, and the problem that such a rule is addressing.

Second, the proposal would restrict the agency's ability to implement and enforce mission-critical laws by blocking the EPA from using many kinds of scientific studies vital to its decisionmaking, including studies that rely on personal health data, confidential business information, intellectual property, or older studies for which the authors or data sources may not be accessible. 

Finally, the rule would grant the EPA administrator broad authority to exclude individual studies or entire decisions from being subject to its provisions on a case-by-case basis, giving the administrator unprecedented power to decide what the best available science is. 

The rule does nothing to advance the cause of transparency in the broader scientific community. This issue is best addressed with the full involvement of scientists, science advisors, and scientific institutions, not designed solely by political appointees.

The EPA must not move forward with this rulemaking as it would undermine science-based decisionmaking at the agency, and limit its ability to protect public health and the environment.

It would excessively burden EPA staff with reanalyzing data from each study used to support a rulemaking which is not only pointless as peer review already is a check on the work of researchers, but it would be resource intensive and time consuming. Furthermore, peer review is superior to review by political appointees in EPA.

The proposal includes no analyses of the rule's effect on the EPA's mission-related work, the costs or benefits of such a move, and the problem that such a rule is addressing. Indeed, the major ""problem"" appears to be that the administration prefers ideology to scientific fact.

Second, the proposal would restrict the agency's ability to implement and enforce mission-critical laws by blocking the EPA from using many kinds of scientific studies vital to its decisionmaking, including studies that rely on personal health data, confidential business information, intellectual property, or older studies for which the authors or data sources may not be accessible. The best and most extensive data allows for the best decisionmaking.

Finally, the rule would grant the EPA administrator broad authority to exclude individual studies or entire decisions from being subject to its provisions on a case-by-case basis, giving the administrator unprecedented power to decide what the best available science is. The politically-appointed EPA administrator is not necessarily qualified to make such judgments, and indeed is subject to substantial political pressure to make decisions in conformance with ideology, rather than science.

I strongly oppose the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) proposal to restrict scientific research and studies that are used in its decision making processes.

In issuing the proposed rule, the EPA claims it will make science more transparent. However, implementation of the rule will put researchers in the difficult position of choosing between protecting privacy and security versus allowing their work to be used in EPA decision making. It would excessively burden EPA staff with reanalyzing data from each study used to support a rule making which is pointless as peer review serves as a check on the work of researchers, and it is ridiculously resource intensive and time consuming for no real purpose.
 
The EPA's proposed rule has three fundamental flaws that render it unfeasible. 

First, the agency provides insufficient justification and analyses to support the proposed rule. The proposal includes NO analyses of the rule's effect on the EPA's mission-related work, the costs or benefits of such a move, and the problem that such a rule is addressing.

Second, and more importantly, the proposal would restrict the agency's ability to implement and enforce mission-critical laws by blocking the EPA from using many kinds of scientific studies vital to its decision making, including studies that rely on personal health data, confidential business information, intellectual property, or older studies for which the authors or data sources may not be accessible. 

Finally, the rule would dangerously grant the EPA administrator broad authority to exclude individual studies or entire decisions from being subject to its provisions on a case-by-case basis, giving the administrator unprecedented power to decide what the best available science is.  

The proposed rule does nothing to advance the cause of transparency in the broader scientific community. This issue is best addressed with the full involvement of scientists, science advisors, and scientific institutions, not designed solely by political appointees.

The EPA must not move forward with this rulemaking as it would undermine science-based decisionmaking at the agency, and limit its ability to protect public health and the environment.

Rather than making science more transparent, as the EPA claims it would, this rule would put researchers in the difficult position of choosing between protecting privacy and security versus allowing their work to be used in EPA decision-making.

The EPA sole job is to protect the citizens from corporations that chose to pollute, poison, contaminate or overall harm the environment.   Hence an environment that is harmed ... harms its citizens and wildlife.  There is no excuse for the EPA do do anything to relax Or compromise our hard won regulations that had to be put in place because corporations can not be trusted to do what is right.... they will do what puts $ in their pockets and lie that what the do does not harm!!!!  PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT!!!!! PROTECT OUR CITIZENS and WILDLIFE!!!!!

2) The proposal would restrict the agency's ability to implement and enforce mission-critical laws by blocking the EPA from using many kinds of scientific studies vital to its decision-making, including studies that rely on personal health data, confidential business information, intellectual property, or older studies for which the authors or data sources may not be accessible. 

3) The rule grants the EPA administrator broad authority to exclude individual studies or entire decisions from being subject to its provisions on a case-by-case basis, giving the administrator unprecedented power to decide what the best available science is.  This is wholly unacceptable and unjustified.

The rule does nothing to advance the cause of transparency in the broader scientific community. ""Transparency,"" here, is used as a cover term to try to mask a flawed proposal that is against science and against the welfare of our country and citizenry.  This issue is best addressed with the full involvement of scientists, science advisors, and scientific institutions, not designed solely by political appointees.

The EPA must not move forward with this rulemaking as it would undermine science-based decisionmaking at the agency, and limit its ability to protect public health and the environment.

I believe that the human race has made great advances because of scientific research and applications.  Therefore I am appalled that the EPA might limit the use of research studies as you determine national policies therefore I am writing to strongly oppose the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) proposal to restrict the science that is used in its decisionmaking processes.
 
Here are my thoughts on this matter:
In issuing this proposed rule, the EPA claims that it would be making science more transparent. But it instead would put researchers in the difficult position of choosing between protecting privacy and security versus allowing their work to be used in EPA decisionmaking. It would excessively burden EPA staff with reanalyzing data from each study used to support a rulemaking which is not only pointless as peer review already is a check on the work of researchers, but it would be resource intensive and time consuming.

I am writing to strongly oppose the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) proposal to restrict the science that is used in its decisionmaking processes.

In issuing this proposed rule, the EPA claims that it would be making science more transparent; instead it would only put researchers in the difficult position of choosing between protecting privacy and security versus allowing their work to be used in EPA decision making.  This has nothing to do with ""making science more transparent"" but is rather a means of allowing scientific studies and findings to be ignored! Additionally, it would needlessly burden EPA staff with reanalyzing the data from each study used to support a rule making -- pointless!, as peer review on any meaningful scientific publication has already served as the meaningful data check on the work of researchers.

The EPA's proposed rule has three fundamental flaws that render it unfeasible:

First, the agency provides insufficient justification and analyses to support the rule. The proposal includes no analyses of the rule's effect on the EPA's mission-related work, the costs or benefits of such a move, nor the problem that such a proposed rule is addressing.

Second, the proposal would restrict the agency's ability to implement and enforce mission-critical laws by blocking the EPA from using many kinds of scientific studies vital to its decision making, including studies that rely on personal health data, confidential business information, and/or intellectual property, as well as older studies for which the authors or data sources may no longer be accessible. 

Finally, the proposed rule would grant the EPA administrator broad authority to exclude individual studies or entire decisions from being subject to its provisions on a case-by-case basis, giving the administrator unprecedented power to cherry-pick what they consider is the best available science -- that's not how ""best available science"" is formulated.

The rule does nothing to advance the cause of transparency in the broader scientific community -- this is simply a proposed internal EPA administrative ruling.   The proposed rule is not meaningful to the appropriate processes and procedures for scientific study review and verification -- it is not a change vis-a-vis peer-review.

The issue is ensuring that the ""best available science"" is used in rule-making is best addressed with the full involvement of scientists, science advisors, and scientific institutions, not by designing a rule to allow validated scientific findings to be ignored while allowing political appointees to do their own cherry-picking  of studies to use.

The EPA must not move forward with this rulemaking as it would undermine science-based decisionmaking at the agency, and limit its ability to protect public health and the environment.

I truly fear the world my children will inherit and thus, I am writing to strongly oppose the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) proposal to restrict the science that is used in its decisionmaking processes.

In issuing this proposed rule, the EPA claims that it would be making science more transparent. But it instead would put researchers in the difficult position of choosing between protecting privacy and security versus allowing their work to be used in EPA decisionmaking. It would excessively burden EPA staff with reanalyzing data from each study used to support a rulemaking which is not only pointless as peer review already is a check on the work of researchers, but it would be resource intensive and time consuming.
 
The EPA's proposed rule has three fundamental flaws that render it unfeasible. 

First, the agency provides insufficient justification and analyses to support the rule. The proposal includes no analyses of the rule's effect on the EPA's mission-related work, the costs or benefits of such a move, and the problem that such a rule is addressing.

Second, the proposal would restrict the agency's ability to implement and enforce mission-critical laws by blocking the EPA from using many kinds of scientific studies vital to its decisionmaking, including studies that rely on personal health data, confidential business information, intellectual property, or older studies for which the authors or data sources may not be accessible. 

Finally, the rule would grant the EPA administrator broad authority to exclude individual studies or entire decisions from being subject to its provisions on a case-by-case basis, giving the administrator unprecedented power to decide what the best available science is. 

The rule does nothing to advance the cause of transparency in the broader scientific community. This issue is best addressed with the full involvement of scientists, science advisors, and scientific institutions, not designed solely by political appointees.

As we have clearly seen recently, not trusting and following the recommendations of the scientific community in the first place has made this pandemic worse.  Lets not keep making that mistake.

The EPA must not move forward with this rulemaking as it would undermine science-based decisionmaking at the agency, and limit its ability to protect public health and the environment.

There will be a time when we will re-establish the departments that uphold the environmental safety measures we so desperately need. Trump has devalued environmental health even more than any other president (not a tough group to do better than), but we won't suffer under his ""leadership"" for too much longer, even if, worst case scenario he is not unseated by the corporate democrat. We will eventually have a true leader, with more than a half a clue, who will make a much more functional EPA that will weep over the pathetic legacy of previous power-mongers and then get to the important business of science and compassion based environmental stewardship.

3rd -- The rule would grant the EPA administrator broad authority to exclude individual studies or entire decisions from being subject to its provisions on a case-by-case basis, giving the administrator unprecedented and possibly harmful power to decide what the best available science is.

Second, the proposal would restrict the agency's ability to implement and enforce mission-critical laws by blocking the EPA from using many kinds of scientific studies vital to its decisionmaking, including studies that rely on personal health data, confidential business information, intellectual property, or older studies for which the authors or data sources may not be accessible. 

Finally, the rule would grant the EPA administrator broad authority to exclude individual studies or entire decisions from being subject to its provisions on a case-by-case basis, giving the administrator unprecedented power to decide what the best available science is. 

The rule does nothing to advance the cause of transparency in the broader scientific community. This issue is best addressed with the full involvement of scientists, science advisors, and scientific institutions, not designed solely by political appointees.
Peer reviewed scientific research is the primary way we can approach the pending disaster of climate change and global warming.  I am hoping that my children, grandchildren, and the generations to come will have the same opportunity that I have had to live in and enjoy this wonderful planet.

I am writing to strongly oppose the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) proposal to restrict the science that is used in its decisionmaking processes.

In issuing this proposed rule, the EPA claims that it would be making science more transparent. But it instead would put researchers in the difficult position of choosing between protecting privacy and security versus allowing their work to be used in EPA decisionmaking. It would excessively burden EPA staff with reanalyzing data from each study used to support a rulemaking which is not only pointless as peer review already is a check on the work of researchers, but it would be resource intensive and time consuming.

Why exclude information that is relevant?  Why exclude studies whose results were published in scientific journals, vetted by other scientists, and confirmed by independent research?

In issuing this proposed rule, the EPA claims that it would be making science more transparent. But it instead would put researchers in the difficult position of choosing between protecting privacy and security versus allowing their work to be used in EPA decisionmaking. It would excessively burden EPA staff with reanalyzing data from each study used to support a rulemaking which is not only pointless as peer review already is a check on the work of researchers, but it would be resource intensive and time consuming.
 
The EPA's proposed rule has three fundamental flaws that render it unfeasible. 

First, the agency provides insufficient justification and analyses to support the rule. The proposal includes no analyses of the rule's effect on the EPA's mission-related work, the costs or benefits of such a move, and the problem that such a rule is addressing.

Our nations Coronavirus epidemic is certainly a warning the EPA should consider carefully. Our current administration is bent on reducing regulations at any cost because they pander to big business. Rewriting EPA regulations because the administration is asking is not good policy and could be disastrous.

I am deeply opposed to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) proposal to restrict the science that is used in its decision-making processes.

The EPA claims that this proposed rule would make science more transparent. What it would actually do is limit researchers access to vital data while placing additional, unnecessary burdens on EPA staff who are charged with protecting our health and safety. It would do so by requiring pointless, time-consuming  reanalysis of data that has already been peer reviewed. It takes time to do the work of keeping us safe. Thats because so much depends on that work being done with extreme care and integrity. This proposal is designed to impede that important work without improving its outcomes in any significant way.
 
The EPA's proposed rule has three fundamental flaws:

1. It includes no analyses of the rule's effect on the EPA's mission-related work, the costs or benefits of such a move, and the issue that such a rule claims to address.

2. The proposal would restrict the agency's ability to implement and enforce mission-critical laws by blocking the EPA from using many kinds of scientific studies vital to its decision making. 

3. It would grant the EPA administrator broad authority to exclude individual studies or entire decisions from being subject to its provisions on a case-by-case basis, giving the administrator unprecedented power over the availability and distribution of scientific evidence.

I am writing to strongly oppose the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) proposal to restrict the science that is used in its decision making processes.  My life has been close to scientists, research, and applying new knowledge to preserve and improve life on our planet.  The effort, dedication, and sacrifice of scientists to produce and share their information should not be ignored by our government.

In issuing this proposed rule, the EPA claims that it would be making science more transparent. But it instead would put researchers in the difficult position of choosing between protecting privacy and security versus allowing their work to be used in EPA decision making. It would excessively burden EPA staff with reanalyzing data from each study used to support a rulemaking which is not only pointless as peer review already is a check on the work of researchers, but it would be resource intensive and time consuming.
 
The EPA's proposed rule has three fundamental flaws that render it unfeasible. 

First, the agency provides insufficient justification and analyses to support the rule. The proposal includes no analyses of the rule's effect on the EPA's mission-related work, the costs or benefits of such a move, and the problem that such a rule is addressing.

Second, the proposal would restrict the agency's ability to implement and enforce mission-critical laws by blocking the EPA from using many kinds of scientific studies vital to its decisionmaking, including studies that rely on personal health data, confidential business information, intellectual property, or older studies for which the authors or data sources may not be accessible. 

Finally, the rule would grant the EPA administrator broad authority to exclude individual studies or entire decisions from being subject to its provisions on a case-by-case basis, giving the administrator unprecedented power to decide what the best available science is. 

The rule does nothing to advance the cause of transparency in the broader scientific community. This issue is best addressed with the full involvement of scientists, science advisors, and scientific institutions, not designed solely by political appointees.

The EPA must not move forward with this rulemaking as it would undermine science-based decisionmaking at the agency, and limit its ability to protect public health and the environment.

I am writing to strongly oppose the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) proposal to restrict the science that is used in its decisionmaking processes. What is the matter with you? It should be obvious, in the middle of the current pandemic, that we need much greater involvement of scientists and widespread dissemination of the science affecting all of our government decisions.

I am writing to strongly oppose the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) proposal to restrict the science that is used in its decisionmaking processes.

In issuing this proposed rule, the EPA claims that it would be making science more transparent. But it limits use of scientific data to make a scientific ruling. This makes NO sense. Speaking as a microbiologist in a pharmaceutical business, we did not select only the data we liked in order to release a product for sale to the public. 

The EPA must not move forward with this rulemaking as it would undermine science-based decisionmaking at the agency, and limit its ability to protect public health and the environment.

Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OA-2018-0259

As a member of the Parkinson's disease community, I am very concerned about the impact the proposed rule will have on scientifically based determinations at the EPA. If enacted in its current form, this proposal would limit the science that can be used in EPA decision-making by putting unnecessary restrictions on the kinds of studies that the EPA can consider. This will affect everything from air pollution standards to chemical regulations.

For example, the EPA is currently reviewing the registration of an herbicide called paraquat. Through peer-reviewed and validated research, paraquat is very strongly associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease. Much of the research relies on large, population-based studies, which is the type of research most impacted by this rule. Without the ability to consider this research, the EPA will miss vital information needed to protect public health, thus placing Americans at risk.
 
Many of the most important studies involving environmental exposures and Parkinson's disease would be excluded from future determinations for one or more of the following reasons:

- The authors did not previously obtain the needed consents to release the data and would thus be subject to criminal penalty if they did so.

- The data cannot be de-identified appropriately while complying with federal privacy protection laws.

- The cost to de-identify would be very high and many research institutions do not have people on staff who can perform the work needed to do so.

The proposal will put researchers in the difficult position of choosing between protecting privacy and allowing their work to be used by the EPA. Please abandon this troublesome rule.

As a member of the Parkinson's disease community, I am very concerned about the impact the proposed rule will have on scientifically based determinations at the EPA. If enacted in its current form, this proposal would limit the science that can be used in EPA decision-making by putting unnecessary restrictions on the kinds of studies that the EPA can consider. This will affect everything from air pollution standards to chemical regulations. 

For example, the EPA is currently reviewing the registration of an herbicide called paraquat. Through peer-reviewed and validated research, paraquat is very strongly associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease. Much of the research relies on large, population-based studies, which is the type of research most impacted by this rule. Without the ability to consider this research, the EPA will miss vital information needed to protect public health, thus placing Americans at risk.

As someone who believes that our air, water, and food should be protected, I am writing to voice my strong opposition to the Trump administrations latest attack on science, public health, and our nations environmental laws.



Under the administrations new proposalwhich has been misleadingly marketed as a means of strengthening transparency in regulatory sciencethe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency could be precluded from relying on important scientific research when establishing the safeguards that protect communities across the country. If the proposed rule is finalized, the EPAs ability to ensure that our air, water, and food are safe will be significantly undermined.



The EPA was created to protect our health and wellbeing by using the best available science. The administrations new plan is a reckless and unlawful attempt to undercut this critical mission. It would needlessly restrict the EPAs ability to use reliable science when making decisions critical to protecting public health and safety.



The timing of the administrations proposal adds insult to injury. As doctors, nurses, scientists, and public-health officials are straining to protect us from an unprecedented pandemicone that has been exacerbated by the administrations rejection of sound sciencethe importance of science-based safeguards could not be clearer.



The administrations proposed rule is dangerous and unlawful. It must be abandoned.

For example, the EPA is currently reviewing the registration of an herbicide called paraquat. Through peer-reviewed and validated research, paraquat is very greatly associated with higher risk of developing Parkinson's Disease.  Clinical studies that would bring us closer to understanding causative relationships rather than simple correlations could not go forth as simply and directly because patient information must be kept confidential.  

I urge you to change the proposed rule.  It is imperative that we keep studying the relationship between toxins and the onset of Parkinson's.  The incidence of the disease is on the rise.  If we do not understand the reasons for this, we cannot stop this increase.

Much of the research available throughout the scientific community, but not available to the public at large, is invaluable to EPA in making well considered determinations as to the benefit/risk assessment of moving forward with regulations and/or products that have a direct bearing on Parkinson's Disease.  Without the ability to consider this research, the EPA will miss vital information needed to protect public health, thus placing Americans at risk. 
 
Many of the most important studies involving environmental exposures and Parkinson's disease would be excluded from future determinations for one or more of the following reasons:

- The authors did not previously obtain the needed consents to release the data and would thus be subject to criminal penalty if they did so.

- The data cannot be de-identified appropriately while complying with federal privacy protection laws.

- The cost to de-identify would be very high and many research institutions do not have people on staff who can perform the work needed to do so.

The proposal will put researchers in the difficult position of choosing between protecting privacy and allowing their work to be used by the EPA. Please abandon this troublesome rule. 

In conclusion, the EPA has a responsibility to consider ""all"" available scientific research data, whether or not available within the public domain, before making such important determinations having a direct effect on its citizens.

As a member of the Parkinson's disease community, I am very concerned about the impact the proposed rule will have on scientifically based determinations at the EPA.  If enacted in its current form, this proposal would limit the science that can be used in EPA decision-making by putting unnecessary restrictions on the kinds of studies that the EPA can consider.  This will affect everything from air pollution standards to chemical regulations.

Please realize what you are doing to our future.  To YOUR KIDS FUTURE not just mine

I am writing to strongly oppose the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) proposal to restrict the science that is used in its decisionmaking processes.

In issuing this proposed rule, the EPA claims that it would be making science more transparent. But it instead would put researchers in the difficult position of choosing between protecting privacy and security versus allowing their work to be used in EPA decisionmaking. It would excessively burden EPA staff with reanalyzing data from each study used to support a rulemaking which is not only pointless as peer review already is a check on the work of researchers, but it would be resource intensive and time consuming.
 
The EPA's proposed rule has three fundamental flaws that render it unfeasible. 

First, the agency provides insufficient justification and analyses to support the rule. The proposal includes no analyses of the rule's effect on the EPA's mission-related work, the costs or benefits of such a move, and the problem that such a rule is addressing.

Second, the proposal would restrict the agency's ability to implement and enforce mission-critical laws by blocking the EPA from using many kinds of scientific studies vital to its decisionmaking, including studies that rely on personal health data, confidential business information, intellectual property, or older studies for which the authors or data sources may not be accessible. 

Finally, the rule would grant the EPA administrator broad authority to exclude individual studies or entire decisions from being subject to its provisions on a case-by-case basis, giving the administrator unprecedented power to decide what the best available science is. 

The rule does nothing to advance the cause of transparency in the broader scientific community. This issue is best addressed with the full involvement of scientists, science advisors, and scientific institutions, not designed solely by political appointees.

The EPA must not move forward with this rulemaking as it would undermine science-based decisionmaking at the agency, and limit its ability to protect public health and the environment.

At a time when the lives of millions of people are literally in the hands of scientists, it is unconscionable that the EPA thinks it can discount and ignore science in its decisions.  

I am writing to strongly oppose the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) proposal to restrict the science that is used in its decision-making processes.

In issuing this proposed rule, the EPA claims that it would be making science more transparent. But it instead would put researchers in the difficult position of choosing between protecting privacy and security versus allowing their work to be used in EPA decision-making. It would excessively burden EPA staff with reanalyzing data from each study used to support a rule-making which is not only pointless as peer review already is a check on the work of researchers, but it would be resource intensive and time consuming.
 
The EPA's proposed rule has three fundamental flaws that render it unfeasible. 

First, the agency provides insufficient justification and analyses to support the rule. The proposal includes no analyses of the rule's effect on the EPA's mission-related work, the costs or benefits of such a move, and the problem that such a rule is addressing.

Second, the proposal would restrict the agency's ability to implement and enforce mission-critical laws by blocking the EPA from using many kinds of scientific studies vital to its decision-making, including studies that rely on personal health data, confidential business information, intellectual property, or older studies for which the authors or data sources may not be accessible. 

Finally, the rule would grant the EPA administrator broad authority to exclude individual studies or entire decisions from being subject to its provisions on a case-by-case basis, giving the administrator unprecedented power to decide what the best available science is. 

The rule does nothing to advance the cause of transparency in the broader scientific community. This issue is best addressed with the full involvement of scientists, science advisers, and scientific institutions, not designed solely by political appointees.

The EPA must not move forward with this rulemaking as it would undermine science-based decisionmaking at the agency, and limit its ability to protect public health and the environment.

Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OA-2018-0259

As a member of the Parkinson's disease community, I am very concerned about the impact the proposed rule will have on scientifically based determinations at the EPA. If enacted in its current form, this proposal would limit the science that can be used in EPA decision-making by putting unnecessary restrictions on the kinds of studies that the EPA can consider. This will affect everything from air pollution standards to chemical regulations. 

For example, the EPA is currently reviewing the registration of an herbicide called paraquat. Through peer-reviewed and validated research, paraquat is very strongly associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease. Much of the research relies on large, population-based studies, which is the type of research most impacted by this rule. Without the ability to consider this research, the EPA will miss vital information needed to protect public health, thus placing Americans at risk. 
  
Many of the most important studies involving environmental exposures and Parkinson's disease would be excluded from future determinations for one or more of the following reasons:
- The authors did not previously obtain the needed consents to release the data and would thus be subject to criminal penalty if they did so.
- The data cannot be de-identified appropriately while complying with federal privacy protection laws.
- The cost to de-identify would be very high and many research institutions do not have people on staff who can perform the work needed to do so.
The proposal will put researchers in the difficult position of choosing between protecting privacy and allowing their work to be used by the EPA. Please abandon this troublesome rule.

Stop being the Environmental PREVENTION Agency, or even more accurately, the Environmental DESTRUCTION Agency and stifling or denying science and facts.  You are working hard to damage the health of people and the environment and aid in the destruction of the planet.  This is no time for short sighted greed.  

In issuing this proposed rule, the EPA claims that it would be making science more transparent. But it instead would put researchers in the difficult position of choosing between protecting privacy and security versus allowing their work to be used in EPA decisionmaking. It would excessively burden EPA staff with reanalyzing data from each study used to support a rulemaking which is not only pointless as peer review already is a check on the work of researchers, but it would be resource intensive and time consuming.
 
The EPA's proposed rule has three fundamental flaws that render it unfeasible. 

First, the agency provides insufficient justification and analyses to support the rule. The proposal includes no analyses of the rule's effect on the EPA's mission-related work, the costs or benefits of such a move, and the problem that such a rule is addressing.

Second, the proposal would restrict the agency's ability to implement and enforce mission-critical laws by blocking the EPA from using many kinds of scientific studies vital to its decisionmaking, including studies that rely on personal health data, confidential business information, intellectual property, or older studies for which the authors or data sources may not be accessible. 

Finally, the rule would grant the EPA administrator broad authority to exclude individual studies or entire decisions from being subject to its provisions on a case-by-case basis, giving the administrator unprecedented power to decide what the best available science is. 

The rule does nothing to advance the cause of transparency in the broader scientific community. This issue is best addressed with the full involvement of scientists, science advisors, and scientific institutions, not designed solely by political appointees.

In my opinion, the EPA's proposed rule has three critical flaws that render it unfeasible. 

First, the agency provides insufficient justification and analyses to support the rule. The proposal includes no analyses of the rule's effect on the EPA's mission-related work, the costs or benefits of such a move, and the problem that such a rule is addressing.  The current administration just wants to remove what they see as unnecessary restrictions on the way they want to do business.  Their lack of understanding of the importance of science is glaringly obvious.

Second, the proposal would restrict the agency's ability to implement and enforce mission-critical laws by blocking the EPA from using many kinds of scientific studies vital to its decisionmaking, including studies that rely on personal health data, confidential business information, intellectual property, or older studies for which the authors or data sources may not be accessible. 

Finally, the rule would grant the EPA administrator broad authority to exclude individual studies or entire decisions from being subject to its provisions on a case-by-case basis, giving the administrator unprecedented power to decide what the best available science is.  Its never a good idea to give one individual that degree of power.  Abuse of that power will surely follow.

The rule does nothing to advance the cause of transparency in the broader scientific community. This issue is best addressed with the full involvement of scientists, science advisors, and scientific institutions, not designed solely by political appointees.  Particularly political appointees who do not have a degree and experience in a science field or even know the least bit about science.

Please, do not make this horrendous decision.

10,1,9.00006E+14,"Dear Administrator Andrew Wheeler,

I am writing to strongly oppose the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) proposal to restrict the science that is used in its decisionmaking processes.

In issuing this proposed rule, the EPA claims that it would be making science more transparent. But it instead would put researchers in the difficult position of choosing between protecting privacy and security versus allowing their work to be used in EPA decisionmaking. It would excessively burden EPA staff with reanalyzing data from each study used to support a rulemaking which is not only pointless as peer review already is a check on the work of researchers, but it would be resource intensive and time consuming.
 
The EPA's proposed rule has three fundamental flaws that render it unfeasible. 

First, the agency provides insufficient justification and analyses to support the rule. The proposal includes no analyses of the rule's effect on the EPA's mission-related work, the costs or benefits of such a move, and the problem that such a rule is addressing.

Second, the proposal would restrict the agency's ability to implement and enforce mission-critical laws by blocking the EPA from using many kinds of scientific studies vital to its decisionmaking, including studies that rely on personal health data, confidential business information, intellectual property, or older studies for which the authors or data sources may not be accessible. 

Finally, the rule would grant the EPA administrator broad authority to exclude individual studies or entire decisions from being subject to its provisions on a case-by-case basis, giving the administrator unprecedented power to decide what the best available science is. This particular problem is glaringly malevolent when the EPA administrator works for corporate vampiric gluttons whose sole reason for existing is profit over life.

The rule does nothing to advance the cause of transparency in the broader scientific community. This issue is best addressed with the full involvement of scientists, science advisors, and scientific institutions, not designed solely by political appointees.

The EPA must not move forward with this rulemaking as it would undermine science-based decisionmaking at the agency, and limit its ability to protect public health and the environment.

This proposal would restrict the types of science considered by the EPA when developing regulationsincluding disallowing the use of scientific studies that dont reveal underlying data such as the identity of individual participants. However, the EPA itself, and many in the scientific community, have long held the view that protecting the identity of participants is essential to their participation.

Without the use of studies that protect the identity of participants, the health and welfare of the public and the environment will be at risk. If this rule is approved, it would threaten environmental restoration efforts and associated economic benefits in the Chesapeake Bay region.

The air and water pollution regulations impacted by this rule are exactly those the Chesapeake Bay TMDL and the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement (collectively known as the Chesapeake Clean Water Blueprint) is relying on to restore the Bay. The Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure and an economic engine for businesses throughout the region. In fact, the Chesapeake Bay produces approximately 500 million pounds of seafood a year. In 2015, Maryland and Virginia brought in $290 million in landings revenue, supported nearly 29,000 jobs, and generated approximately $2.5 billion dollars in sales. Recreational fishing supported over 12,000 jobs and generated $1.24 billion dollars in sales.

Now, more than ever, the EPA should not be restricting science that would impact public health and restoration efforts in the Chesapeake Bay.

Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OA-2018-0259

As a member of the Parkinson's disease community, I am very concerned about the impact the proposed rule will have on scientifically based determinations at the EPA. If enacted in its current form, this proposal would limit the science that can be used in EPA decision-making by putting unnecessary restrictions on the kinds of studies that the EPA can consider. This will affect everything from air pollution standards to chemical regulations. 

For example, the EPA is currently reviewing the registration of an herbicide called paraquat. Through peer-reviewed and validated research, paraquat is very strongly associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease. Much of the research relies on large, population-based studies, which is the type of research most impacted by this rule. Without the ability to consider this research, the EPA will miss vital information needed to protect public health, thus placing Americans at risk. 
 
Many of the most important studies involving environmental exposures and Parkinson's disease would be excluded from future determinations for one or more of the following reasons:

- The authors did not previously obtain the needed consents to release the data and would thus be subject to criminal penalty if they did so.

- The data cannot be de-identified appropriately while complying with federal privacy protection laws.

- The cost to de-identify would be very high and many research institutions do not have people on staff who can perform the work needed to do so.

The proposal will put researchers in the difficult position of choosing between protecting privacy and allowing their work to be used by the EPA. Please abandon this troublesome rule.

Our region is plagued by high air pollution, stormwater runoff, and a legacy of industrial pollution of our soils and groundwater. To fix this and protect public health, we need the support of the EPA and science-based decision-making that takes the best and latest data into accountincluding public health data that cannot be made public. Most health related studies have very strict privacy rules and many of them can't be made public - but still provide indispensable data and thus need to be part of the consideration process.
 
The proposed rule would exclude validated, qualified, peer-reviewed science if the data was not publicly available. EPA would therefore rely on studies with publicly available data, regardless of whether these studies were the most robust or best suited to the decision at hand. Decisions could be based on science that does not represent the latest scientific consensus, but on science arbitrarily selected by the administrator. The decisions of what scientific studies to rely on shouldn't be made by a political appointee, they should be made by scientists.

The EPA must not move forward with this rulemaking as it would undermine science-based decisionmaking at the agency, and limit its ability to protect public health and the environment.

EPA should be acting to further protect public health not undermine its ability to do its job. EPAs Supplemental Transparency Proposal continues the effort to limit which scientific studies EPA will use in major regulatory decisions. The Federal Housekeeping Statute alone or with bedrock environmental laws like the Clean Air Act gives EPA the authority to pick and choose the science it will use in protecting public health. EPA should continue to use long recognized public health studies to best protect the public from contaminants to the air, water, and land and limit human exposure to harmful chemicals.

Peer-reviewed studies assessing the effects of pollution exposure on humans, based on actual personal health data  which by law must be kept confidential  are among the best science available to the Agency. The misguided proposal would direct EPA to ignore this data unless that confidential personal health data were made publicly available.

Reg. 15,396) that would limit the scientific data the EPA can use.
 
Our region is plagued by high air pollution, stormwater runoff, and a legacy of industrial pollution of our soils and groundwater. To fix this and protect public health, we need the support of the EPA and science-based decision-making that takes the best and latest data into accountincluding public health data that cannot be made public.
 
The proposed rule would exclude validated, qualified, peer-reviewed science if the data was not publicly available. EPA would therefore rely on studies with publicly available data, regardless of whether these studies were the most robust or best suited to the decision at hand. Decisions could be based on science that does not represent the latest scientific consensus, but on science arbitrarily selected by the administrator. The decisions of what scientific studies to rely on shouldn't be made by a political appointee, they should be made by scientists.
 
Please reject the proposal.

10,1,0900006484471bf2,"Dear Administrator Andrew Wheeler,

The current pandemic should be indication enough of the dangers of excluding science from the decision-making process.

The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) proposal to restrict the science that is used in its decision making processes is inadvisable in the extreme.
 
The EPA's proposed rule has three fundamental flaws that render it unfeasible: 

First, the agency provides insufficient justification and analyses to support the rule. 

Second, the proposal would restrict the agency's ability to implement and enforce mission-critical laws by blocking the EPA from using many kinds of scientific studies, including studies that rely on personal health data, confidential business information, intellectual property, or older studies for which the authors or data sources may not be accessible.   **As a retired medical librarian, I know that these studies are invaluable in providing scientific overview for decisions about health and environmental safety.**

Finally, the rule would grant the EPA administrator broad authority to exclude individual studies or entire decisions from being subject to its provisions on a case-by-case basis, giving the administrator unprecedented power to decide what the best available science is.  Decisions need to be based on science, not on the prejudices or personal or financial interests of a single administrator. 

These flaws make the proposed rule unacceptable. 

The EPA must not move forward with this rulemaking as it would undermine science-based decisionmaking at the agency, and limit its ability to protect public health and the environment.

Sincerely,
Amrita Burdick

Air AND Water pollution harms our health. Research is linking poor health outcomes from COVID-19 to increased exposure to fine particle pollution. EPA should be acting to FURTHER protect public health not undermine its ability to do its job. EPAs Supplemental Transparency Proposal continues the effort to limit which scientific studies EPA will use in major regulatory decisions. The Federal Housekeeping Statute alone or with bedrock environmental laws like the Clean Air Act gives EPA the authority to pick and choose the science it will use in protecting public health. EPA should CONTINUE to use long recognized public health studies to best protect the public from contaminants to the air, water, and land and limit human exposure to harmful chemicals.

Essential standards to decrease pollution should be based on the best science available, NOT arbitrary decisions about preferring some studies over others over unnecessary access to data and certainly not based on choices by political appointees about which scientific studies can and cant be used in determining what is safe for our children.   

EPA should withdraw this dangerous supplemental proposal and abandon the effort to undermine science and environmental safeguards. As we continue to struggle with the COVID-19 crisis, EPA should be stepping up to clear the air, not retreat from doing so under the guise of transparency.

I am writing to strongly oppose the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) proposal to restrict the science that is used in its decisionmaking processes.  I want an EPA that is built on solid science and that actually Protects the environment!  I want the EPA run by scientists who have integrity  and care for the environment,  not by greedy, corrupt, former monsanto minions, or the like.

In issuing this proposed rule, the EPA claims that it would be making science more transparent. But it instead would put researchers in the difficult position of choosing between protecting privacy and security versus allowing their work to be used in EPA decisionmaking. It would excessively burden EPA staff with reanalyzing data from each study used to support a rulemaking which is not only pointless as peer review already is a check on the work of researchers, but it would be resource intensive and time consuming.
 
The EPA's proposed rule has three fundamental flaws that render it unfeasible. 

First, the agency provides insufficient justification and analyses to support the rule. The proposal includes no analyses of the rule's effect on the EPA's mission-related work, the costs or benefits of such a move, and the problem that such a rule is addressing.

Second, the proposal would restrict the agency's ability to implement and enforce mission-critical laws by blocking the EPA from using many kinds of scientific studies vital to its decisionmaking, including studies that rely on personal health data, confidential business information, intellectual property, or older studies for which the authors or data sources may not be accessible. 

Finally, the rule would grant the EPA administrator broad authority to exclude individual studies or entire decisions from being subject to its provisions on a case-by-case basis, giving the administrator unprecedented power to decide what the best available science is. This is foolish and undemocratic.  It makes me ashamed of our government and the EPA.

The rule does nothing to advance the cause of transparency in the broader scientific community. This issue is best addressed with the full involvement of scientists, science advisors, and scientific institutions, not designed solely by political appointees.
       Make the EPA ""great again"" by gutting the corrupt policies and officials.  Everything the EPA does should be rigorously backed by solid science that is inclusive of all legitimate studies. 

The EPA must not move forward with this rulemaking as it would undermine science-based decisionmaking at the agency, and limit its ability to protect public health and the environment.

I am writing to strongly oppose the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) proposal to restrict the science that is used in its decisionmaking processes.

Stop with these transparent attempts to favor big businesses over established science. Do your job and protect ALL the citizens of the US, not just the wealthy ones.

In issuing this proposed rule, the EPA claims that it would be making science more transparent. But it instead would put researchers in the difficult position of choosing between protecting privacy and security versus allowing their work to be used in EPA decisionmaking. It would excessively burden EPA staff with reanalyzing data from each study used to support a rulemaking which is not only pointless as peer review already is a check on the work of researchers, but it would be resource intensive and time consuming.
 
The EPA's proposed rule has three fundamental flaws that render it unfeasible. 

First, the agency provides insufficient justification and analyses to support the rule. The proposal includes no analyses of the rule's effect on the EPA's mission-related work, the costs or benefits of such a move, and the problem that such a rule is addressing.

Second, the proposal would restrict the agency's ability to implement and enforce mission-critical laws by blocking the EPA from using many kinds of scientific studies vital to its decisionmaking, including studies that rely on personal health data, confidential business information, intellectual property, or older studies for which the authors or data sources may not be accessible. 

Finally, the rule would grant the EPA administrator broad authority to exclude individual studies or entire decisions from being subject to its provisions on a case-by-case basis, giving the administrator unprecedented power to decide what the best available science is. 

The rule does nothing to advance the cause of transparency in the broader scientific community. This issue is best addressed with the full involvement of scientists, science advisors, and scientific institutions, not designed solely by political appointees.

The EPA must not move forward with this rulemaking as it would undermine science-based decisionmaking at the agency, and limit its ability to protect public health and the environment.

Everyone knows that you are doing this at the behest of the White House, corporations and the individuals who value profits over safety.

It is obvious ... you absolutely will not have the best available science if any of it is excluded. Unbiased scientists, without an agenda to support the best interests of their employers, can separate the reliable from the unreliable results.

The Covid-19 virus and its spread, reinforces the need to give scientists and medical professionals more funding and authority when it comes to all environmental and health issues.  We can no longer put profits above human health and the health of our planet.  I am writing to strongly oppose the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) proposal to restrict the science that is used in its decision making processes.

In issuing this proposed rule, the EPA claims that it would be making science more transparent. But it instead would put researchers in the difficult position of choosing between protecting privacy and security versus allowing their work to be used in EPA decision making. It would excessively burden EPA staff with reanalyzing data from each study used to support a rule making which is not only pointless as peer review already is a check on the work of researchers, but it would be resource intensive and time consuming.
 
The EPA's proposed rule has three fundamental flaws that render it unfeasible. 

First, the agency provides insufficient justification and analyses to support the rule. The proposal includes no analyses of the rule's effect on the EPA's mission-related work, the costs or benefits of such a move, and the problem that such a rule is addressing.

Second, the proposal would restrict the agency's ability to implement and enforce mission-critical laws by blocking the EPA from using many kinds of scientific studies vital to its decisionmaking, including studies that rely on personal health data, confidential business information, intellectual property, or older studies for which the authors or data sources may not be accessible. 

Finally, the rule would grant the EPA administrator broad authority to exclude individual studies or entire decisions from being subject to its provisions on a case-by-case basis, giving the administrator unprecedented power to decide what the best available science is. 

The rule does nothing to advance the cause of transparency in the broader scientific community. This issue is best addressed with the full involvement of scientists, science advisors, and scientific institutions, not designed solely by political appointees.

The EPA must not move forward with this rulemaking as it would undermine science-based decisionmaking at the agency, and limit its ability to protect public health and the environment.

9,1,090000648446e589,"Dear Administrator Andrew Wheeler,

I am writing to strongly oppose the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) proposal to restrict the science that is used in its decisionmaking processes. We are unprepared in the present pandemic emergency in large part due to government suppressing science for short sighted unsustainable profits in industry.

In issuing this proposed rule, the EPA claims that it would be making science more transparent. But it instead would put researchers in the difficult position of choosing between protecting privacy and security versus allowing their work to be used in EPA decisionmaking. It would excessively burden EPA staff with reanalyzing data from each study used to support a rulemaking which is not only pointless as peer review already is a check on the work of researchers, but it would be resource intensive and time consuming.
 
The EPA's proposed rule has three fundamental flaws that render it unfeasible. 

First, the agency provides insufficient justification and analyses to support the rule. The proposal includes no analyses of the rule's effect on the EPA's mission-related work, the costs or benefits of such a move, and the problem that such a rule is addressing.

Second, the proposal would restrict the agency's ability to implement and enforce mission-critical laws by blocking the EPA from using many kinds of scientific studies vital to its decisionmaking, including studies that rely on personal health data, confidential business information, intellectual property, or older studies for which the authors or data sources may not be accessible. 

Finally, the rule would grant the EPA administrator broad authority to exclude individual studies or entire decisions from being subject to its provisions on a case-by-case basis, giving the administrator unprecedented power to decide what the best available science is. 

The rule does nothing to advance the cause of transparency in the broader scientific community. This issue is best addressed with the full involvement of scientists, science advisors, and scientific institutions, not designed solely by political appointees.

The EPA must not move forward with this rulemaking as it would undermine science-based decisionmaking at the agency, and limit its ability to protect public health and the environment.

WINIFRED LUTZ

Attention: EPA-HQ-OA-2018-0259-9322

Proposed Rulemaking for Strengthening Transparency in Regulatory Science  

Dear Administrator Wheeler: 

As a business leader, I ask that you withdraw your proposed rulemaking for ""Strengthening Transparency in Regulatory Science"" and seek input on future environmental policy changes from the rapidly growing responsible and sustainable business community. 

Not only will this proposed rule be detrimental to the development of environmental and public health regulations, but it will also hurt businesses across all sectors by intensifying the climate crisis and impacting air, water, and wildlife. 

Overwhelmingly, scientists agree that a man-made climate crisis is upon us, warranting the need for strong environmental regulations now more than ever. Impacts from the climate crisis, such as rising oceans and disruptions to supply chains, pose existential threats to our entire economy, indeed to human life itself. Unchecked, the climate crisis will impact GDP by $44 trillion in just the next 40 years, while a study from the Brookings Institute says by 2100, climate impacts will slash global GDP by more than 20 percent. Yet, this proposed change would require scientific studies to make all their raw data public, including confidential medical records, or else not be considered for future environmental rulemaking processes. While public statements from the EPA have deemed this a step towards transparency, it will in fact do just the opposite by limiting legitimate research that goes into creating clean water, clean air, and other vital regulations for the environment and public health because of privacy requirements. This proposed rule does not make long-term business sense, as environmental and public health regulations directly affect businesses and their workers.  

This proposed rule will also limit the EPA's ability to create scientifically informed clean air regulations, which is especially reckless, right now, as the world faces COVID-19. Scientists have made the link between poor air quality and increased COVID-19 related health risks. 

Similarly, the proposed rule will weaken clean water protections. Clean waterways are vital for sectors like breweries, the seafood industry, and the hospitality industry. The craft brewing industry contributed $76.2 billion to the U.S. economy in 2017, more than 500,000 jobs, and depends heavily on clean water to create a high-quality product for its consumers. Consumers spend $887 billion annually on outdoor recreation overall, and nearly $175 billion on fishing, kayaking, rafting, canoeing, scuba diving and other water sports alone - all of which thrives on a visibly healthy water supply. Further, clean water is important for the real estate industry - home values can erode by as much as $85,000 each on land near water with high nutrient pollution levels. A clean water source allows each of these industries to provide safe products and activities for their customers to enjoy, while also reducing the cost of water treatment for each sector. 

Science forms the basis of environmental and public health policy. This proposed rule undermines the foundations of policy nationwide. I urge you to withdraw your proposed rulemaking for ""Strengthening Transparency in Regulatory Science"" to maintain public health and environmental legislation nationwide and to protect the American people and its businesses.

Proposed Rulemaking for Strengthening Transparency in Regulatory Science  

Dear Administrator Wheeler: 

As a business leader, researcher and life long problem solver, I ask that you withdraw your proposed rulemaking for ""Strengthening Transparency in Regulatory Science"" and seek input on future environmental policy changes from the rapidly growing responsible and sustainable business community. It is obvious you are using this as a foil to block use of science in our ideologically driven political arena. Evidence-based government is the hallmark of a democracy. When evidence is blocked as a basis for making decisions it looks more like fascism. 

Regulatory and policy making bodies have to protect confidential data- much is the same way that chemical company data is protected as CBI under TSCA. Not only will this proposed rule be detrimental to the development of environmental and public health regulations, but it will also hurt businesses across all sectors by intensifying the climate crisis and impacting air, water, and wildlife. 

Overwhelmingly, scientists agree that a man-made climate crisis is upon us, warranting the need for strong environmental regulations now more than ever. Impacts from the climate crisis, such as rising oceans and disruptions to supply chains, pose existential threats to our entire economy, indeed to human life itself. I find it odd that the business community in every sector is directly addressing climate change, yet the EPA seeks to ban the use of science to make important environmental and business decisions- since they are one in the same.

Unchecked, the climate crisis will impact GDP by $44 trillion in just the next 40 years, while a study from the Brookings Institute says by 2100, climate impacts will slash global GDP by more than 20 percent. Yet, this proposed change would require scientific studies to make all their raw data public, including confidential medical records, or else not be considered for future environmental rulemaking processes.

This proposed rule will also limit the EPA's ability to create scientifically informed clean air regulations, which is especially reckless, right now, as the world faces COVID-19. Yes, all people get sick from poor environmental regulations. Even the velvet economy architects have not found a way to shield your children from ambient air quality.
