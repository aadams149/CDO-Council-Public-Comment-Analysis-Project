Ih as become apparent that we can are are finding new and cleaner ways to produce energy. What we have not done successfully is to protect our most precious resource -- clean drinking water -- from the waste produced by the prodcuction of coal and other fossil fuels. 

When you enact or help develop clean methods of energy production it is a winning strategy for all: clean air and water; new and valuable jobs in a non-coal economy and retooling plants and re-training workers who are needed for the new high paying jobs that we need to create to keep more production of our essential goods, services, products and food in the United States. 

This current crisis, in which we are all washing hands many times a day with water that we depend on to be clean, is a great illustration of why we need to preserve clean water in all our communities.

2,1,09000064844a51b1,"I am commenting to strongly oppose EPA's Coal Ash Permitting Proposal (Docket # EPA-HQ-OLEM-2019-0361). This proposal weakens the 2015 coal ash rule safeguards and will threaten human health and safety.  I am appalled that this Administration sees fit to propose a rule that so blatantly allows industry to pass off the costs of doing business onto surrounding residents.  Allowing more unlined coal ash ponds to exist in perpetuity, with little or no groundwater testing, is contrary to any basic sense of human decency, much less public health and safety.  This rule needs to be withdrawn.

The 2015 Coal Ash Rule safeguards are supported by sound science and common sense. Public health scientists and advocates pushed for years to establish these safeguards. The proposed rule, on the other hand, would benefit polluters. Coal powered public utilities and coal mining companies have lobbied for it since Trump was elected.

The EPA's proposed rule would establish a permit program for coal ash ponds and landfills on Indian lands, territories, and in states that do not have approval to implement their own permit programs -- currently all states except Oklahoma and Georgia.

Some of the most egregious flaws of the proposal would allow the EPA to: 
 Grant ""permits for life"" to all coal ash dumps, new or old, lined or unlined. Never-expiring permits are nearly unheard of for federal permitting programs. 
 Issue permits with little to no public participation. 
 Grant ""one size fits all"" permits for life that do not account for the highly variable risks of coal ash ponds and landfills. 
 Automatically approve permits with little or no review by the permitting agency. 
 Unlawfully allow EPA to authorize ""noncompliance"" with no restrictions on how long noncompliance would be tolerated or which safeguards a permittee could continue to violate. 
 Fail to take into account extensive recently collected industry data that have revealed the extent of the widespread and severe water pollution from coal ash dumps. 

The EPA should be working to make Americans safer, not endanger them further by throwing protections from toxic pollution out the window. The Coal Ash Permitting Proposal will expose more Americans to hazardous pollution from coal ash, including to carcinogens like arsenic, hexavalent chromium and radium; neurotoxins like lithium and lead, and poisons that kill fish and wildlife like selenium and cadmium. The EPA needs to stop trying to gut the public health protections in the Coal Ash Rule, and instead strengthen the rule, as ordered by a federal Court of Appeals in August 2018.

Thanks to the 2015 Coal Ash Rule coal plant owners have already completed hundreds of inspections, published critical groundwater quality data, identified over a hundred sites where cleanup of contaminated groundwater must soon begin, and disclosed the identity of leaking and dangerous coal ash ponds that must close. The commonsense standards of the 2015 rule -- which received more than a half-million supporting comments from the public -- are helping to clean water and safeguard public health. President Trump's attempt to weaken this rule is nothing more than a total giveaway to the coal industry. It must be rejected. 

-EPA's duty is to protect our health and the environment from coal ash. 
-EPA's duty is to guarantee safe water, clean air, and a healthy environment -- free from toxic waste. 
-EPA's duty is not to protect polluters and ignore the damage they inflict on our health and natural resources. 
-EPA exists to serve and protect the American public. Public participation in its rule making and permitting processes adds expertise and local knowledge that are essential to the EPA fulfilling its mandate.

However, driving down mercury emissions alone would yield annual co-benefits like gains in 4,700 avoided heart attacks, 130,000 asthma attacks and 11,000 premature deaths.

The 2015 Coal Ash Rule safeguards are supported by sound science and common sense. Public health scientists and advocates pushed for years to establish these safeguards. The proposed rule, on the other hand, would benefit polluters. Coal powered public utilities and coal mining companies have lobbied for it since Trump was elected.


The EPA's proposed rule would establish a permit program for coal ash ponds and landfills on Indian lands, territories, and in states that do not have approval to implement their own permit programs -- currently all states except Oklahoma and Georgia.


Some of the most egregious flaws of the proposal would allow the EPA to: 

 Grant ""permits for life"" to all coal ash dumps, new or old, lined or unlined. Never-expiring permits are nearly unheard of for federal permitting programs. 

 Issue permits with little to no public participation. 

 Grant ""one size fits all"" permits for life that do not account for the highly variable risks of coal ash ponds and landfills. 

 Automatically approve permits with little or no review by the permitting agency. 

 Unlawfully allow EPA to authorize ""noncompliance"" with no restrictions on how long noncompliance would be tolerated or which safeguards a permittee could continue to violate. 

 Fail to take into account extensive recently collected industry data that have revealed the extent of the widespread and severe water pollution from coal ash dumps. 


The EPA should be working to make Americans safer, not endanger them further by throwing protections from toxic pollution out the window. The Coal Ash Permitting Proposal will expose more Americans to hazardous pollution from coal ash, including to carcinogens like arsenic, hexavalent chromium and radium; neurotoxins like lithium and lead, and poisons that kill fish and wildlife like selenium and cadmium. The EPA needs to stop trying to gut the public health protections in the Coal Ash Rule, and instead strengthen the rule, as ordered by a federal Court of Appeals in August 2018.


Thanks to the 2015 Coal Ash Rule coal plant owners have already completed hundreds of inspections, published critical groundwater quality data, identified over a hundred sites where cleanup of contaminated groundwater must soon begin, and disclosed the identity of leaking and dangerous coal ash ponds that must close. The commonsense standards of the 2015 rule -- which received more than a half-million supporting comments from the public -- are helping to clean water and safeguard public health.

Especially in light of the lessened pollution and improved air and water quality observed  during shutdowns of industry due to COVID-19 it should be obvious that existing rules and regulations need to be enforced at the least, and strengthened in the future.

No matter the wealth to be gained, nor the cost to do so, our Earth's air, water, and soil needs protected world-wide and the U.S. should be a leader in doing so.",2,2,EPA-HQ-OLEM-2019-0361-0001
10,5,09000064844aa101,"I strongly oppose EPA's Coal Ash Permitting Proposal.  EPA's purpose is to protect the environment and the public.  These changes would increase toxic pollution in the ground and in water, allowing industry to dispose of toxic substances with no accountability to the public.  Greed and profit are the only reasons to allow these changes.  The proposed changes are polluting and strongly detrimental to people, resources and the planet we all need to respect and nurture.  EPA needs to fulfill its mission, not be perverted in its purpose.",1,1,EPA-HQ-OLEM-2019-0361-0001
