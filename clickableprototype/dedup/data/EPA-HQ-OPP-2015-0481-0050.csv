Contamination of wildlife habitat by Anticoagulant Rodenticide (AR) is as devastating as a massive oil spill.  With injuries to wildlife that are below the skin, in the blood and in the liver and sometimes decimating entire populations or entire species of birds of prey, reptiles, as well as large cats, and other wildlife.

From ants to apex predators like the mountain lion, these poisons, specifically brodifacoum, bromadiolone, difethialone, difenacoum, diphacinone and chlorophacinone, leach through the food web, just like DDT, which was banned 48 years ago.

Exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides can cause illness and reproductive failure, impacting whole populations and entire ecosystems, just like DDT.

Dear EPA,

The widespread contamination of wildlife by Anticoagulant Rodenticide (AR) is like a massive oil spill, except the injuries are below the skin, in the blood and in the liver - but the ecological damage is comparable.

From ants to apex predators like the mountain lion, these poisons, specifically brodifacoum, bromadiolone, difethialone, difenacoum, diphacinone and chlorophacinone, leach through the food web, just like DDT, which was banned 48 years ago.

Exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides can cause illness and reproductive failure, impacting whole populations and entire ecosystems, just like DDT.

If people could see how damaging these poisons are to our wildlife and ecosystems, we would not be discussing their potential ecological impact in 2020 - they would have been banned years ago, just like DDT.

As a taxpayer, a voter and a citizen, I am writing to ask you to immediately ban rodenticides throughout the country. These poisons have no place in our country. After being ingested by rodents they are consumed by other wildlife and often pets, and as a result there's secondary poisoning and contamination of the food chain.

Second generation anticoagulant rodenticides are extremely dangerous because they have higher potency than prior generations of poisons. They don't just endanger wildlife but also pose a real safety threat to our children and our pets.

While it is important to know the amount of poison that will impair or kill an animal, more importantly it's the widespread, seemingly unstoppable contamination of wildlife that is most concerning. From ants to apex predators, these poisons are entering the food chain just like DDT. What's worse, no one knows the true extent of damage because there's been limited testing. Only two states have made a concerted effort to test for anticoagulant rodenticides, and those were limited, at best. The EPA must use its authority to request studies to find out the extent of damage and in the meantime suspend use of products containing anticoagulants, specifically, brodifacoum, bromadiolone, difethialone, difenacoum, diphacinone and chlorophacinone.

 

The reevaluation of these anticoagulants should include new studies to account for the missing data recommended by the US EPA's 2004 Assessment, specifically evidence on the sub-lethal, chronic effects on reproduction or various species, data on chronic exposure, bioaccumulation and rates or retention in target and nontarget species, and data on the various non-target species that frequent baited areas. EPA must not allow continued use of these poisons, specifically, brodifacoum, bromadiolone, difethialone, difenacoum, diphacinone and chlorophacinone, without this information.

There are safer products and safer methods of controlling rodent populations.

4,1,09000064847229d2,I have seen the deadly results of rodenticides in wildlife. The horrible wildlife death resulting from eating a rodent who had ingested rodenticides was indescribable. It is very harmful for children and family pets as well. Very deadly. There is no place for this poison in our society. Pest control people are deceitful when presenting bait boxes as an option. They say it is fine. First of all it is an agonizing death for the rodent. And after the rodent eats the poison it can then die in my neighbors yard where it can poison the family pet or a child.

4,1,0900006484726d5c,"Anticoagulant rodenticides should have been banned years (or decades) ago.  They have no place being used in any ecosystem.  They don't just kill the rats that have been targeted for eradication.  Instead they kill any animal that ingests them or ingests a rat that has ingested them.  The result is that multiple species end up dying horrible deaths, including endangered species, something that would be unacceptable at any time, but is even worse now that we are in the middle of a massive extinction crisis.  In addition to killing wild animals, these horrible rodenticides are notorious for killing people's pets, leaving the family members to whom those pets belong, including children, to grieve and in some cases to pay huge veterinary bills trying to save their beloved animals lives.  And then there are the children who ingest rodenticides.  According to the American Association of Poison Control Centers the average number of human rodenticide poisonings per year between 1999 and 2009 is 1,700.  That is absolutely outrageous.

The EPA has a responsibility to act as a steward of the environment and a protector of wildlife, people's pets and human life.  That means banning all anticoagulant rodenticides, not just second generation even more powerful rodenticides.  They pose  a danger to healthy ecosystems and to life, both animal and human and there is no place for them anywhere.  

Two years ago a man in my neighborhood thought he had rats and put out anticoagulant rodenticides on my block - a block with several children and lots of pets.  Thanks to him, we found several neighborhood cats dead.  He ended up leaving the neighborhood after several of us told him we would file police complaints.  I'm still angry and sickened by what he did.  In a country with responsible regulations he would not have been able to buy the crap he bought and cause the harm and suffering that he caused.

It's frustrating that these second generation rodenticides are even more dangerous than the first generation which were bad enough. I'm sure you are aware that just a single dose has a long half-life of more than 100 days in a rat's liver so the potential to kill unintended victims is extremely high.

Also these poisons can also harm kids and pets so if the US govt. doesn't care if these poisons kill unintended wildlife, they should at least be concerned about them harming our pets and kids. Too often young kids accidentally consume poison intended for rodents thinking that is food. And our companion animals can also come into contact with the poison either by eating it directly or consuming poisoned rodents. It's a vicious cycle.

The data shows that between 1999 and 2009, the American Association of Poison Control Centers reported an average of 17,000 humans who were exposed to rodenticides annually. Wow! That is an extremely high number and roughly 15,000 of the incidents involved kids younger than six. Do you not find that disturbing and scary?

So please, do the right thing and ban the use of these pesticides NOW before anymore unintended victims are harmed or die from these unnecessarily toxic poisons.

Super-toxic anticoagulant rodenticides have no place in our ecosystem.  Initially consumed by rats who are then consumed by other wildlifeup the chain to critical primary predators.  The result of this insidious process is secondary poisoning and contamination of the food chain.

From ants to apex predators, these poisons are entering the food chain. Only two states have made a concerted effort to test for anticoagulant rodenticides, and those were limited. The EPA must use its authority to request studies to find out the extent of damage and, until then, suspend use of products containing anticoagulants.

From EPA's assessment 2004: Most rodenticide incidents likely go undetected: ""Most rodenticide incidents likely go undetected except in those rare instances when a predator carcass happens to be exposed in an open area (e.g., roadside) where it is observed by someone willing to take the time and effort to report it to the proper authorities (McDonald et al. 1998, Newton et al. 1999). In many situations, carcasses might not be detected, death may be attributed to natural mortality, or an incident may not be reported for a variety of reasons, including ignorance, apathy, or failure of authorities to investigate and confirm the cause of death (Rymph 1994, Vyas 1999).""

On Page 12 of the ERA, the EPA indicates it reviewed incident reporting to inform the risk management decision, however, on Page 27 it states few of the total incidents of wildlife contamination are actually observed and reported, concluding on Page 63, ""incident data should be interpreted with caution,"" so, that leads me to believe the EPA does not have evidence to make any solid decision and should require all states conduct studies before these anticoagulant rodenticides, specifically brodifacoum, bromadiolone, difethialone, difenacoum, diphacinone and chlorophacinone can be reregistered.

When first reevaluating these poisons in 1998, the EPA made an uncorroborated presumption about poison placed near buildings and in sewers. They presumed wildlife would not be impacted. Rats and mice carry the poison in their bodies away from buildings where they are found by predators and scavengers. Because of that faulty presumption, EPA did not require registrars to conduct studies for the 1998 reevaluation, nor did EPA review related literature.

Therefore, pursuant to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), the EPA must suspend use of products containing anticoagulants, specifically, brodifacoum, bromadiolone, difethialone, difenacoum, diphacinone and chlorophacinone.

While it is important to know the amount of poison that will impair or kill an animal, more importantly it's the widespread, seemingly unstoppable contamination of wildlife that is most concerning. From ants to apex predators, these poisons are entering the food chain just like DDT.

There are safer products and safer methods of controlling rodent populations. These particular anticoagulants, specifically, brodifacoum, bromadiolone, difethialone, difenacoum, diphacinone and chlorophacinone, are obsolete. Given the harm they inflict and the damage they have done to ecosystems, they should be banned, immediately.

According to the EPA, the incident reports are not representational of the true level of contamination. From EPA's assessment 2004: Most rodenticide incidents likely go undetected:

""Most rodenticide incidents likely go undetected except in those rare instances when a predator carcass happens to be exposed in an open area (e.g., roadside) where it is observed by someone willing to take the time and effort to report it to the proper authorities (McDonald et al. 1998, Newton et al. 1999). In many situations, carcasses might not be detected, death may be attributed to natural mortality, or an incident may not be reported for a variety of reasons, including ignorance, apathy, or failure of authorities to investigate and confirm the cause of death (Rymph 1994, Vyas 1999).""

There is mention of risk mitigation. The only way to stop wildlife from being harmed is to stop the sale and use of these poisons, specifically, brodifacoum, bromadiolone, difethialone, difenacoum, diphacinone and chlorophacinone, now!

On Page 12 of the ERA, the EPA indicates it reviewed incident reporting to inform the risk management decision, however, on Page 27 it states few of the total incidents of wildlife contamination are actually observed and reported, concluding on Page 63, ""incident data should be interpreted with caution,"" so, what that leads me to believe is the EPA does not evidence to make any solid decision and should require all states conduct studies before these anticoagulant rodenticides, specifically brodifacoum, bromadiolone, difethialone, difenacoum, diphacinone and chlorophacinone can be reregistered. In the meantime, sale and use of products containing these poisons should be halted, immediately.

When first reevaluating these poisons in 1998, the EPA made a presumption about poison placed alongside buildings and in sewers. They presumed wildlife would not be impacted. We know that's not true. Rats and mice carry the poison in their bodies away from buildings where they are found by predators and scavengers. Because of that faulty assumption, EPA did not require registrars to conduct studies for the 1998 reevaluation, nor did EPA review related literature.

We now know placement of anticoagulants near buildings and in sewers poses a potential risk to nontarget wildlife. See page 63. Therefore, the EPA, by law, MUST order registrars to conduct these specific studies BEFORE these poisons, specifically brodifacoum, bromadiolone, difethialone, difenacoum, diphacinone and chlorophacinone, can be reregistered. In the meantime, there needs to be a moratorium on their use, nationwide!

From the comparatively few studies that have been conducted, it appears that more 90% of predators and scavengers are contaminated with anticoagulant rodenticides - that's alarming! And yet the widespread prevalence of these poisons and their impact on whole populations is going largely unnoticed. EPA, you must halt the use of anticoagulants, specifically brodifacoum, bromadiolone, difethialone, difenacoum, diphacinone and chlorophacinone, and call for nationwide studies to document the extent of damage to wild populations and our environment.",2,2,EPA-HQ-OPP-2015-0481-0050

I happen to live in an area with abundant wildlife, and it's horrifying to see dead animals in gutters who have been poisoned by rodenticides. You might ask how it's possible to know how these animals died, but when I see a dead rodent with a swarm of DEAD ants around the body, it's clear just how toxic these chemicals are! The widespread contamination of wildlife by Anticoagulant Rodenticide (AR) is like a massive oil spill, except the injuries are below the skin, in the blood and in the liver - but the ecological damage is comparable.

From ants to apex predators like the mountain lion, these poisons, specifically brodifacoum, bromadiolone, difethialone, difenacoum, diphacinone and chlorophacinone, leach through the food web, just like DDT, which was banned 48 years ago.

Exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides can cause illness and reproductive failure, impacting whole populations and entire ecosystems!

If people could see how damaging these poisons are to our wildlife and ecosystems, we would not be discussing their potential ecological impact in 2020 - they would have been banned years ago, just like DDT.

I URGE you to prohibit the use of these pesticides! Please, do not let another year pass and ban them now!
