EPA Must Always Assess Synergistic Effects of Pesticides
EPA is requesting comment on its proposal to require data that will help it determine the synergistic effects of some pesticides. EPA has received on the pressure on a number of fronts, including a report by the Center for Biological Diversity, a report by its own Inspector General, a letter from 35 Congressional Representatives, and research pointing to the unavoidability of synergistic effects. Despite all of the evidence that synergism is the rule rather than the exception, EPAs consideration focuses on a narrow range of cases in which pesticide product patents make claims of synergy.

One such product is Dows Enlist Duo, which combines glyphosate and 2,4-D in an attempt to overcome weed resistance. The focus on products and tank mixes where synergism is a selling point brings to light the fact that as a rule, EPA does not request efficacy data in registering pesticides not intended to protect public health.

One of these combinations is Dow's Enlist Duo, which combines 2,4-D with the already highly problematic glyphosate (which should be banned entirely here rather than being combined with anything else).

The problem is that it is difficult to acquire the data to determine the risks and benefits of chemical mixtures in the air, soil, water, and agricultural products; moreover, synergistic effects can involve interactions with pharmaceuticals and natural metabolic processes in humans and other living organisms. This difficulty should make us much more cautious, not less.

In the midst of the sixth mass extinction and myriad environmental crises, we really need to cease our reliance on chemical weapons against nature and turn to age-old methods for sustainable agriculture.  Moreover, there is absolutely no excuse to allow glyphosate to be used to control weeds in public areas -- the answer is to curate public grounds properly, restore the health of these systems, plant meadows and use plant pairings and other natural methods to create beauty and prevent overgrowth of certain ""thug"" plants.",1,1,EPA-HQ-OPP-2017-0433-0001
