I oppose the rollback of the nuisance provision of Ohio's Clean Air Act regulations.

The nuisance provision allows Ohio residents to take local pollution problems into their own hands and protect their communities by taking polluters to court. Without this provision, it will be more difficult for Ohioans to address local pollution problems. Eliminating this provision also destroys an important tool that gives both regulators and Ohio residents flexibility to address serious health concerns based on new scientific developments.

I have taken the online course environmental law offered by the University of North Carolina. And the substance and basis of all environmental law turns on and starts with nuisance as a reason to file a lawsuit in violation of one's rights. 

The base of the principal is simply that you as a private individual and or property owner have the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and that someone on another piece of property is destroying that and that includes by polluting your air or floating in water or polluting the with noise. 

This is not a minor issue this is the best of all environmental law and the scabs that are trying to undermine our legal system and destroy the biological integrity of this planet need to be hung. 

Why don't you work on that Amendment?

Releasing industry from well founded regulations pursuing the best interests of the majority of the public is unconscionable. Profit for an industry at the expense of the public at large is unacceptable. 

Government exists to further the interests of public welfare and should not be subverted to the interests of the monied few.

Utilities understand that they need to move to cleaner sources of power. Why cant the Republican Party understand that pollution is real and that it kills? Or that taking away health care kills? Or that more and more weapons of death kills? Or that taking food from the hungry kills? Or torture? Or destroying nature? Greed, supported by bigotry and irresponsibility, have that effect.

The nuisance provision allows Ohio residents to take local pollution problems into their own hands and protect their communities by taking polluters to court.

I don't understand why government entities continually make it so hard for citizens to be safe in their own cities and towns. But perhaps a good place to start would be looking at corporations (i.e. potential polluters) who are big donors to political campaigns.

We count on the EPA to protect our air and water. Please make that your mission, above all else. We can have industry standards that reduce or eliminate pollution, and if those are removed or weakened, we will pay a price with our health and the well-being of future generations. The EPA should be a watchdog, and citizens should be encouraged to alert it to pollution that affects their property values and health.
