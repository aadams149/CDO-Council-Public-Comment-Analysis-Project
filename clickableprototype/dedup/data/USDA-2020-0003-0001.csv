1,1,09000064847b3e91,"The proposed Agriculture Innovation Agenda, while commendable, generally overlooks rangelands and rangeland-based livestock production. To food production and environmental conditions goals by 2050, the Agenda must include rangelands and expanded use of current and future technologies discovered through scientific research. Universally applied, technologies like rangeland health indicators can contribute meaningfully to meeting 2050 goals.",4,4,USDA-2020-0003-0001
