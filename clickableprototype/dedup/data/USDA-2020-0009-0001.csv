This policy is UnAmerican and whoever thinks that it would be a good idea is unAmerican too.I urge you to reject the Departments proposal to change the rules that apply to taxpayer-funded faith-based organizations that deliver social services. The proposed changes would harm religious freedom.

The proposed rules strip away religious freedom protections from people, often vulnerable and marginalized, who use government-funded social services. Removing requirements that beneficiaries be provided with a notice of their religious freedom rights and that providers take reasonable steps to refer beneficiaries to alternative providers if requested makes it harder for people to get services. People in need should never be faced with the stark choice between accessing the services they need or retaining their religious freedom protections.
 
At the same time, the rules expand religious exemptions to taxpayer-funded faith-based providers. This paves the way for providers to refuse to provide key services and opens the door to discrimination in taxpayer-funded programs. The proposed regulations put the interests of taxpayer-funded entities, some of which receive millions of dollars each year of government money, ahead of the needs of people seeking critical services.

All these so-called religious freedom are the exact opposite. It's a brazen attempt to impose some religious views upon others who don't share those same opinions.

The proposed rules strip away religious freedom protections from people, often vulnerable and marginalized, who use government-funded social services. Removing requirements that beneficiaries be provided with a notice of their religious freedom rights and that providers take reasonable steps to refer beneficiaries to alternative providers if requested makes it harder for people to get services. People in need should never be faced with the stark choice between accessing the services they need or retaining their religious freedom protections.
 
At the same time, the rules expand religious exemptions to taxpayer-funded faith-based providers. This paves the way for providers to refuse to provide key services and opens the door to discrimination in taxpayer-funded programs. The proposed regulations put the interests of taxpayer-funded entities, some of which receive millions of dollars each year of government money, ahead of the needs of people seeking critical services.
 
I urge you to reject these proposed changes and protect, rather than undermine, the rights of individuals your social service programs are designed to serve.

Sincerely,
Wilmer Ortiz",68,67,USDA-2020-0009-0001

Nobody has the right to impose their religious beliefs on other people, whose freedom of religion is equally protected. 

I urge you to reject the Departments proposal to change the rules that apply to taxpayer-funded faith-based organizations that deliver social services. The proposed changes would harm religious freedom.

The proposed rules strip away religious freedom protections from people, often vulnerable and marginalized, who use government-funded social services. Removing requirements that beneficiaries be provided with a notice of their religious freedom rights and that providers take reasonable steps to refer beneficiaries to alternative providers if requested makes it harder for people to get services. People in need should never be faced with the stark choice between accessing the services they need or retaining their religious freedom protections.
 
At the same time, the rules expand religious exemptions to taxpayer-funded faith-based providers. This paves the way for providers to refuse to provide key services and opens the door to discrimination in taxpayer-funded programs. The proposed regulations put the interests of taxpayer-funded entities, some of which receive millions of dollars each year of government money, ahead of the needs of people seeking critical services.
 
I urge you to reject these proposed changes and protect, rather than undermine, the rights of individuals your social service programs are designed to serve.

People in need should never be faced with the stark choice between accessing the services they need or retaining their religious freedom protections.
 
At the same time, the rules expand religious exemptions to taxpayer-funded faith-based providers. This paves the way for providers to refuse to provide key services and opens the door to discrimination in taxpayer-funded programs. The proposed regulations put the interests of taxpayer-funded entities, some of which receive millions of dollars each year of government money, ahead of the needs of people seeking critical services.
 
I urge you to reject these proposed changes and protect, rather than undermine, the rights of individuals your social service programs are designed to serve.

5,1,9.00E+90,"Dear Secretary Sonny Perdue,

I urge you to reject the Departments proposal to change the rules that apply to taxpayer-funded faith-based organizations that deliver social services. The proposed changes would harm religious freedom.

The proposed rules strip away religious freedom protections from people, often vulnerable and marginalized, who use government-funded social services. Removing requirements that beneficiaries be provided with a notice of their religious freedom rights and that providers take reasonable steps to refer beneficiaries to alternative providers if requested makes it harder for people to get services. People in need should never be faced with the stark choice between accessing the services they need or retaining their religious freedom protections.
 
At the same time, the rules expand religious exemptions to taxpayer-funded faith-based providers. This paves the way for providers to refuse to provide key services and opens the door to discrimination in taxpayer-funded programs. The proposed regulations put the interests of taxpayer-funded entities, some of which receive millions of dollars each year of government money, ahead of the needs of people seeking critical services.
 
I urge you to reject these proposed changes and protect, rather than undermine, the rights of individuals your social service programs are designed to serve.

I urge you to reject the Departments proposal to change the rules that apply to taxpayer-funded faith-based organizations that deliver social services. The proposed changes would harm religious freedom.

Do LGBTQ+ and others who are legal US residents and taxpayers receive a discounted tax rate because they will not be treated as equal should this rule be passed? These  proposed rules will make them unequal and often vulnerable and marginalized, many use government-funded social services. Removing requirements that beneficiaries be provided with a notice of their religious freedom rights and that providers take reasonable steps to refer beneficiaries to alternative providers if requested makes it harder for people to get services. People in need should never be faced with the stark choice between accessing the services they need or retaining their religious freedom protections.

The proposed regulations put the interests of taxpayer-funded entities, some of which receive millions of dollars each year of government money, ahead of the needs of people seeking critical services.Religious organizations are run as businesses, they should be taxed accordingly.

Will religious groups become welcoming greeters at our airports to legally discriminate and make visitors feel unwelcome on arrival should they make a determination that they are gay or for other spurious reasons? Does this sound far fetched? Remember that in the past religious groups have actively harassed mourners at military funerals for all sorts of reasons.
 
I urge you to reject these proposed changes and protect, rather than undermine, the rights of individuals your social service programs are designed to serve. So called Religious exemption will create a Pandoras box of issues. Freedom of religion is already ingrained in our laws, these proposed rule changes will create extreme division in this country. I am objecting strenuously at having my taxes support these so called religious freedom rules.

5,1,9.00E+18,"Dear Secretary Sonny Perdue,

I urge you to reject the Departments proposal to change the rules that apply to taxpayer-funded faith-based organizations that deliver social services. The proposed changes would harm religious freedom.

The proposed rules strip away religious freedom protections from people, often vulnerable and marginalized, who use government-funded social services. Removing requirements that beneficiaries be provided with a notice of their religious freedom rights and that providers take reasonable steps to refer beneficiaries to alternative providers if requested makes it harder for people to get services. People in need should never be faced with the stark choice between accessing the services they need or retaining their religious freedom protections.
 
At the same time, the rules expand religious exemptions to taxpayer-funded faith-based providers. This paves the way for providers to refuse to provide key services and opens the door to discrimination in taxpayer-funded programs. The proposed regulations put the interests of taxpayer-funded entities, some of which receive millions of dollars each year of government money, ahead of the needs of people seeking critical services.
 
I urge you to reject these proposed changes and protect, rather than undermine, the rights of individuals your social service programs are designed to serve.

Sincerely,
Catherine Malec",327,43,USDA-2020-0009-0001

5,1,090000648434d8ad,"Dear Secretary Sonny Perdue,

I urge you to reject the Departments proposal to change the rules that apply to taxpayer-funded faith-based organizations that deliver social services. The proposed changes would harm religious freedom.

The proposed rules strip away religious freedom protections from people, often vulnerable and marginalized, who use government-funded social services. Removing requirements that beneficiaries be provided with a notice of their religious freedom rights and that providers take reasonable steps to refer beneficiaries to alternative providers if requested makes it harder for people to get services. People in need should never be faced with the stark choice between accessing the services they need or retaining their religious freedom protections.
 
At the same time, the rules expand religious exemptions to taxpayer-funded faith-based providers. This paves the way for providers to refuse to provide key services and opens the door to discrimination in taxpayer-funded programs. The proposed regulations put the interests of taxpayer-funded entities, some of which receive millions of dollars each year of government money, ahead of the needs of people seeking critical services.
 
I urge you to reject these proposed changes and protect, rather than undermine, the rights of individuals your social service programs are designed to serve.

I urge you to reject the Departments proposal to change the rules that apply to taxpayer-funded faith-based organizations that deliver social services. The proposed changes would harm religious freedom.

The proposed rules strip away religious freedom protections from people, often vulnerable and marginalized, who use government-funded social services. Removing requirements that beneficiaries be provided with a notice of their religious freedom rights and that providers take reasonable steps to refer beneficiaries to alternative providers if requested makes it harder for people to get services. People in need should never be faced with the stark choice between accessing the services they need or retaining their religious freedom protections.
 
At the same time, the rules expand religious exemptions to taxpayer-funded faith-based providers. This paves the way for providers to refuse to provide key services and opens the door to discrimination in taxpayer-funded programs.

I urge you to reject the Departments proposal to change the rules that apply to taxpayer-funded faith-based organizations that deliver social services. The proposed changes would harm religious freedom.

The proposed rules strip away religious freedom protections from people, often vulnerable and marginalized, who use government-funded social services. Removing requirements that beneficiaries be provided with a notice of their religious freedom rights and that providers take reasonable steps to refer beneficiaries to alternative providers if requested makes it harder for people to get services. People in need should never be faced with the stark choice between accessing the services they need or retaining their religious freedom protections.

If the religious and faith based organizations wish to use the political system to effect social change in line with their beliefs, I submit they are welcome to after they settle up with the social servants at the IRS every year, just like I do.

The cost of their tax exempt status is they have NO say on the matter as an organization in our political system.  That is how it should stay.

Such discrimination does not belong in any organization, religious or secular, that receives taxpayer funding.  If a faith-based organization receives public funds, which is problematic in itself where there is to be no government sponsorship of religion, then safeguards should be in place to assure that no one is denied services based solely on religious differences with the involved agency.

The proposed rules strip away religious freedom protections from people, often vulnerable and marginalized, who use government-funded social services. Removing requirements that beneficiaries be provided with a notice of their religious freedom rights and that providers take reasonable steps to refer beneficiaries to alternative providers if requested makes it harder for people to get services. People in need should never be faced with the stark choice between accessing the services they need or retaining their religious freedom protections.
 
At the same time, the rules expand religious exemptions to taxpayer-funded faith-based providers. This paves the way for providers to refuse to provide key services and opens the door to discrimination in taxpayer-funded programs.

No one should be forced to sacrifice their religious freedom in order to qualify for basic government-funded services. 

The proposed rule will undermine access to critical services for youth such as school lunch programs and 4-H development and mentoring programs. The rule eliminates key religious freedom protections for participants while inviting employment discrimination by the government-funded service providers that are supposed to be serving everyone.

Removing requirements that beneficiaries be provided with a notice of their religious freedom rights and that providers take reasonable steps to refer beneficiaries to alternative providers if requested makes it harder for people to get services. People in need should never be faced with the stark choice between accessing the services they need or retaining their religious freedom protections.

""The proposed rules strip away religious freedom protections from people, often vulnerable and marginalized, who use government-funded social services"". (ETC.) Where is this proposal published and why isn't it included with this PA? I want to see the ACTUAL documents, who wrote them and what government dept. is responsible for enacting them, though what government office.   ""People in need should never be faced with the stark choice between accessing the services they need or retaining their religious freedom protections."" This statement is gibberish. Who's ""religious freedoms"" are being threatened, by whom and in EXACTLY what ways. ? 

The rest of this statement doesn't explain much of anything. Get your act together and maybe I can help you. As this mission is stated, it makes little sense to most thinking people. Go back to the drawing board. tell us to who this is directed toward, why ( in detail)  and give truthful and carefully investigated statements (with back up material and sources).

It is unconcsiounable to allow taxpayer funds to be used to explicit discrimination. Those providing services with government money should provide them to all, with no religious overtones or requirements.

The proposed rules strip away religious freedom protections from people, often vulnerable and marginalized, who use government-funded social services. Removing requirements that beneficiaries be provided with a notice of their religious freedom rights and that providers take reasonable steps to refer beneficiaries to alternative providers if requested makes it harder for people to get services. People in need should never be faced with the stark choice between accessing the services they need or retaining their religious freedom protections.
 
At the same time, the rules expand religious exemptions to taxpayer-funded faith-based providers. This paves the way for providers to refuse to provide key services and opens the door to discrimination in taxpayer-funded programs. The proposed regulations put the interests of taxpayer-funded entities, some of which receive millions of dollars each year of government money, ahead of the needs of people seeking critical services.
 
I urge you to reject these proposed changes and protect, rather than undermine, the rights of individuals your social service programs are designed to serve.

Removing requirements that beneficiaries be provided with a notice of their religious freedom rights and that providers take reasonable steps to refer beneficiaries to alternative providers if requested makes it harder for people to get services. People in need should never be faced with the stark choice between accessing the services they need or retaining their religious freedom protections.
 
At the same time, the rules expand religious exemptions to taxpayer-funded faith-based providers. This paves the way for providers to refuse to provide key services and opens the door to discrimination in taxpayer-funded programs. The proposed regulations put the interests of taxpayer-funded entities, some of which receive millions of dollars each year of government money, ahead of the needs of people seeking critical services.
 
I urge you to reject these proposed changes and protect, rather than undermine, the rights of individuals your social service programs are designed to serve.
